// The rich-text policy — the rules about what formatting a comment or bio may
// carry, shared by the two places that enforce them.
//
// Both sanitizers are deliberately NOT here. The Worker sanitizes on write with
// parse5 and the browser sanitizes again at render time with DOMPurify, because
// the render path uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML and a reader's safety should not
// depend on every stored row having been written by the current version of the
// Worker. They are two real parsers doing two different jobs — deciding what may
// be stored, and defending what is read — not one policy written twice.
//
// What CAN drift between them, and previously did, is everything they agree on:
// which tags survive, which link schemes are real links, what a link is rewritten
// to carry, and how markup flattens to text. Both files used to carry their own
// copy under a different name, each with a comment telling the reader to keep
// them in sync by hand. They are here instead.
//
// The flattening is the one with a visible failure mode: the editor's character
// counter and the Worker's length limit must measure the same thing, or the
// editor shows "498/500" for a comment the server then rejects.
