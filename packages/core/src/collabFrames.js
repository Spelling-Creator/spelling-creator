// The live-collaboration wire protocol, in one place.
//
// Three ends speak it: the room that relays (apps/api/src/collab-room.js), the
// browser that edits (apps/web/src/lib/collab.js), and the MCP server that joins
// a session on an assistant's behalf (apps/mcp/src/collab.js). Until this module
// existed the type bytes lived in the first two as separate copies joined by a
// comment reading "must match T in collab-room.js" — which is a convention, not
// a guarantee, and a third copy would have made it a coin toss. A renumbered
// frame is not a crash but a silent misread: the wrong branch of a switch, on a
// byte array nobody can eyeball.
//
// Frame shape is a type byte, then the payload. Cursor and chat payloads are
// UTF-8 JSON; document payloads are opaque Yjs update bytes, which the room can
// relay without parsing. Relayed frames (the ones the room fans out to everyone
// else) carry the sender's server-assigned u16 slot between the two, so a peer
// is identified by a number rather than by a name it asserts itself.
//
//   server -> client
//     HELLO    [0][slot u16][role u8]            your slot + role (1=host)
//     UPDATE   [1][yjs update]                    someone edited the document
//     CURSOR   [2][senderSlot u16][utf8 cursor]   where someone is editing
//     CHAT     [3][senderSlot u16][utf8 chat]     a chat message for everyone
//     PRESENCE [4][utf8 roster]                   who's here / who's waiting
//     ADMITTED [5][yjs state]                     you were added; here's the lesson
//     REMOVED  [6][utf8 reason]                   declined / removed / host left
//     ERROR    [7][utf8 message]                  fatal error before/while joining
//     EDITED   [10][senderSlot u16]               the next UPDATE is this peer's
//   client -> server
//     UPDATE   [1][yjs update]                     I edited the document
//     CURSOR   [2][utf8 cursor]                     my caret moved
//     CHAT     [3][utf8 chat]                       send a chat message
//     ADMIT    [8][targetSlot u16]                  host: add this pending guest
//     REMOVE   [9][targetSlot u16]                  host: decline / remove
//
// There is deliberately no separate "full document" frame: a Yjs update encoding
// an entire document is just a large update, and Y.applyUpdate treats it exactly
// like an incremental one. So the host's initial seed, a late joiner's ADMITTED
// payload and a single keystroke all travel the same path.
//
// EDITED is how a peer learns who made an edit, which version history needs to
// credit everyone in a session (see coAuthorTrailers in git/repo.js). It is a
// frame of its own, sent just before the UPDATE it describes, rather than a
// slot added to UPDATE itself. A client that predates it skips a frame type it
// doesn't know; one handed an UPDATE with two extra bytes at the front would
// feed them to Yjs as part of the update instead. Like CURSOR and CHAT, the slot
// is stamped by the room, so nobody can claim someone else's edit, and it is
// sent only for an update that changed the room's document, so replaying one it
// already holds claims nothing either.
