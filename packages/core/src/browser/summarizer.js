// On-device lesson summaries via the browser's Summarizer API.
//
// Unlike the other AI helpers in this app (aiSuggest.js), nothing here talks to
// the Worker: no Turnstile, no API key, no network round-trip. The browser runs a
// local model, so a summary costs us nothing and the lesson text never leaves the
// machine. The trade-off is that the API barely exists yet — it's Chromium-only,
// desktop-only, and gated behind hardware minimums (free disk space, VRAM, an
// unmetered connection for the one-time model download). Most visitors can't use
// it, and the ones who can may need to download the model first.
//
// So every entry point here FAILS CLOSED: if the API is missing, the options
// aren't supported, or the availability probe itself throws, we report
// "unavailable" rather than surfacing an error. The UI (LessonSummary.jsx) then
// renders nothing at all, and a browser without the API simply never sees the
// feature instead of seeing a button that breaks.
//
