// Forking, merging, and pushing — orchestrated.
//
// Forking a lesson clones its repository. Merging compares block ids against the
// commit the two histories share. Pushing sends a history back to the hub. These
// are the flows that make the version control worth having, and they're all a
// handful of calls over the primitives in repo.js / pack.js / merge.js.
//
// Three things to understand here.
//
// 1. A fork keeps a *pointer home*. The hub row records `forkedFrom`, and the
//    fork's repo keeps the original's tip at refs/remotes/upstream/main. Together
//    those let the fork ask "what has the original changed since I left?" and get
//    a real answer — the merge base — rather than having to guess.
//
// 2. Work only ever travels *back* to a lesson through a pull request. A forker
//    cannot push into the lesson they forked, however much they've done to their
//    copy: they submit their history as a proposal (submitPullRequest), and the
//    lesson's author or a trusted collaborator merges it (preparePullMerge +
//    completeMerge) from their own editor. The merge, and the push that follows
//    it, are the reviewer's, under the reviewer's credentials.
//
// 3. A lesson can still have more than one writer — its author and the trusted
//    collaborators they named. So *nobody pushes blind*: before sending a history
//    we compare it with what the hub actually holds (remoteStatus), and we only
//    push a history that already contains that. If the lesson has moved on
//    beneath us, the push is refused (by us here, and by the Worker's
//    compare-and-swap regardless) and the changes are merged first. Without that,
//    whoever saved second would quietly erase the other's work.
