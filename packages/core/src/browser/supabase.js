// written to the companion Worker (`apps/api`; see ../lessons.js),
// which talks to Supabase Postgres server-side with privileged credentials.
//
// The client manages the signed-in session (persisting it in localStorage) and
// hands us a short-lived JWT that the Worker verifies before accepting a
// publish. We use the PKCE flow so the magic-link callback returns a `?code=`
// in the query string rather than access tokens in the URL fragment (hash).

 * This exists to recover from a real gap in @supabase/supabase-js's own
 * startup recovery: if the persisted access token is expired when the page
 * loads, the SDK tries to refresh it once as part of initializing; if that
 * attempt fails with a *retryable* error (e.g. a network hiccup right after
 * the page loads, before the connection is warm), it gives up silently —
 * the session is never loaded into the running client, but it's also not
 * cleared from storage, and nothing later retries (the auto-refresh timer
 * only ever acts on a session it already has in memory). The user looks
 * signed out, indefinitely, despite a perfectly valid session sitting on
 * disk — until the next full page load gets a working attempt. `auth.jsx`
 * uses this to force one more explicit refresh on mount when `getSession()`
 * comes back empty, rather than trusting that single internal attempt.
 *
 * Returns null (a safe no-op for the caller) if anything about this doesn't
 * parse as expected — including if the SDK ever changes its key format,
 * since this deliberately duplicates that private detail rather than
 * depending on it.
