// The lesson library: every lesson this device is holding, and which one is open.
//
// The editor used to keep exactly one working document — a `doc` key in
// IndexedDB, plus a handful of flags beside it saying which hub lesson it was
// attached to. That made "open this lesson" a destructive act: the only way to
// start something new, fork a lesson or import a document was to overwrite the
// draft already there, which is why the editor had a "Replace your current
// work?" dialog guarding three separate flows.
//
// IndexedDB has no reason to hold one lesson rather than fifty, so it holds as
// many as the user makes. A library record is the small stuff — title, counts,
// which hub lesson it's attached to, when it was last touched — and the document
// itself lives in its own store keyed by the same id (see imageStore.js for why
// the two are split). Each lesson also owns a git repository named by that same
// id while it is a local draft (see browser/git/fs.js and `repoIdFor`), so
// switching lessons switches histories too.
//
// Everything here is async — IndexedDB has no synchronous API. Callers await.
//
// Two migrations run once each, in order, on the editor's first mount:
//
//   migrateLocalStorage()  the pre-IndexedDB draft (localStorage, base64 images)
//                          -> the v1 IndexedDB doc + flags
//   migrateToLibrary()     that single doc + flags -> one library record
//
// Both are idempotent, and both are best-effort: a browser that refuses us
// storage still gets a working editor, it just won't remember anything.
