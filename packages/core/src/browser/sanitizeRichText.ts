// Rich text on the browser side — the counterpart to apps/api/src/lib/richtext.js.
//
// Comments and bios are rich text: HTML written with tiptap (RichTextInput.jsx)
// and rendered back as HTML (RichText.jsx). One job lives here:
//
//   `sanitizeRichText` — a second, independent sanitizing pass at render time.
//   The Worker already sanitizes everything it stores, and that is the boundary
//   that actually protects us. This pass exists because the render path uses
//   dangerouslySetInnerHTML, and it should not be the case that the safety of a
//   reader's session depends on every row in the database having been written by
//   the current version of the Worker. Rows predating rich text, rows written by
//   some future path that forgets to sanitize, a bug in the allow-list — all are
//   caught here, at the last moment before the HTML becomes DOM.
//
// The policy it enforces — which tags survive, which link schemes are real
// links, what a link is rewritten to carry — is shared with the Worker in
// @spelling-creator/core/richText, as is the flattening to plain text. Only the
// parser differs: DOMPurify here, parse5 there.
