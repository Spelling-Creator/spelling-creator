// Fully client-side lesson search, powered by Fuse.js. The hub loads every
// published lesson summary up front (GET /lessons), so there's no need to hit a
// backend for search — we build a small in-memory Fuse index over those
// summaries and rank them in the browser. This replaces the old Algolia
// integration with zero network calls and no API keys.
//
// Lesson summaries only carry `title` and `author` (not the full document), so
// those are the searchable fields. Title is weighted higher so a name match
// outranks an author match.

import Fuse from "fuse.js";

// Fuse is fuzzy by default, which covers both as-you-type prefix matches
// ("spel" -> "spelling") and small typos in one pass. `ignoreLocation` lets a
// match land anywhere in the field (not just near the start), and the threshold
// is kept fairly tight so results stay relevant rather than matching almost
// everything.
