// Undoing one change without losing everything after it.
//
// Restoring is the blunt instrument and always worked; this is the precise one,
// and it is the same three-way merge with the sides pointed backwards:
//
//   base   the document as that commit left it
//   ours   the document now
//   theirs the document as it was immediately before
//
// The property worth protecting is the one in the name — everything changed since
// survives — and the property worth protecting *next* is that a change built on
// since raises a conflict rather than being quietly reversed under the author.
// prepareRevert is bound to the browser's filesystem; the call it makes is this.
