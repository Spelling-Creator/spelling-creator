// A branch has a *ref name*, which git stores and which git's own rules bound
// ("Shorter-sections-2"), and a *label*, which is what the person sees ("Shorter
// sections 2"). We don't store the label anywhere: it is the ref name with its
// hyphens read back as spaces, which round-trips the case that matters — someone
// typing a short phrase — without inventing a second place for a name to live and
// go stale.

// at 2 KB in total, and MAX_BRANCHES * (MAX_BRANCH_NAME + an oid + JSON syntax)
