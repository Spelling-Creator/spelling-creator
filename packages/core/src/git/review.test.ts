// Reading a proposal without merging it.
//
// The proposal page now answers two questions off the git objects alone — what
// did the proposer change, and would it merge cleanly — and both answers hinge on
// using the **merge base** rather than the lesson's current tip. Getting that
// wrong doesn't crash; it quietly shows a reviewer the author's own edits as
// though the proposer had made them, which is worse.
//
// So these build the real situation: a lesson, a fork of it, and both sides
// moving on. prepareProposalReview itself is bound to the browser's filesystem,
// but the three calls it makes are these, over the same objects.
