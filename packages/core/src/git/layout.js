// How a lesson document is laid out inside its git repository.
//
// The whole point of the layout: **every block is its own file, named by its
// block id**.
//
//   lesson.json            { title, ageRange, sources?, sections: [{ id, name, blocks: [blockId, ...] }] }
//   blocks/<blockId>.json  the block itself — { id, type, ... }
//
// `lesson.json` is a *manifest*: it holds the structure (which sections exist,
// what they're called, and which blocks they contain, in order) but none of the
// block content. Content lives one-block-per-file under `blocks/`.
//
// This is what makes git's own machinery do the work we want:
//
//   - edit a block   -> exactly one file under blocks/ changes
//   - move a block   -> only lesson.json changes (the block's blob is untouched)
//   - add/remove one -> a file appears/disappears, named by its id
//
// so a plain git tree diff *is* a block-id diff, with no content parsing: two
// blocks are identical exactly when their blob oids are equal, because git
// addresses content by hash. That identity is why diffing (ops.js), merging
// (merge.js) and history (repo.js) can all be expressed as "compare block ids
// and their oids".
//
// Everything here takes `{ fs, gitdir }` rather than reaching for a global, so
// the same code runs against LightningFS in the browser and node:fs in tests.
