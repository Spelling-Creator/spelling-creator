// Moving a lesson's repository between people — the machinery behind
// "forking is cloning".
//
// A lesson's history lives in the browser, so for someone else to fork it the
// objects have to travel. We send them the way git itself does: as a **packfile**
// — every object reachable from the lesson's branch, compressed into one blob —
// plus the refs that point into it. The Worker stores that pair in R2 (see
// apps/api/src/routes/git.js); a forker downloads it, indexes it into their own
// object store, and now holds a genuine clone: the same commits, the same oids,
// the same ancestry.
//
// That shared ancestry is the whole payoff. Because the fork's history and the
// original's descend from commits with identical oids, git can find their merge
// base — which is what lets merge.js do a real *three*-way merge (base/ours/
// theirs) later on, instead of guessing at two.
//
// Lesson images are NOT in the pack. Blocks reference images by content hash and
// the bytes live in R2 already (see lib/imageStore.js and the /images routes), so
// a pack is pure JSON and stays small.
