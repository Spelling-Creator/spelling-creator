// Pull requests — talks to the same `apps/api` Worker as the rest of the hub
// (see lessons.js / comments.js). The browser never touches the database
// directly; it only calls these Worker endpoints.
//
// A pull request is how someone proposes changes to a lesson they don't own:
// they fork it, edit their fork, and open a request against the original. Its
// author — or one of the trusted collaborators they named — reviews it and
// merges it in. Nobody writes another person's lesson without that step.
//
// Worker endpoints this expects (see apps/api/src/routes/pulls.js):
//   GET  {API}/lessons/:id/pulls                 -> { pulls: PullRequest[] }   (public*)
//   POST {API}/lessons/:id/pulls                 -> { pull }                   (Bearer)
//   PUT  {API}/lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/pack      -> { pull }                   (Bearer; packfile body)
//   GET  {API}/lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/pack      -> the packfile               (public*)
//   POST {API}/lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/merge     -> { pull }                   (Bearer)
//   POST {API}/lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/close     -> { pull }                   (Bearer)
//
