# POSIX sh and openssl, deliberately: somebody self-hosting this has Docker and
# nothing else, and asking them to install a Node toolchain to produce a config
# file is a silly thing to ask. openssl ships with macOS and every Linux, and is
# already inside the containers if it somehow isn't on the host.
#
# It exists because .env.example previously asked the reader to mint two JWTs by
# pasting a one-liner out of a comment, and getting that wrong is silent: the
# stack starts, every service looks healthy, and the app answers 502 because the
# value in SERVICE_ROLE_KEY has no dots in it. PostgREST calls that a signing
# error and GoTrue calls it a permissions error; neither says "that is not a
# token".
#
# The two keys are not decorative. PostgREST reads the `role` claim to decide
# what the caller may do:
#
#   ANON_KEY          ships to the browser; public by design.
#   SERVICE_ROLE_KEY  bypasses RLS. Anyone holding it can read and write every
#                     row, including other people's private lesson answers.
#
# Both must be signed with the same JWT_SECRET that PostgREST and GoTrue verify
# against, which is why they are generated together, here, rather than by hand.
