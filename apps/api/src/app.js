// The route table, minus anything that only one host can serve.
//
// Both entry points build on this: src/index.js (the Cloudflare Worker) and
// src/node/server.js (a plain Node process). Everything here runs on either —
// the lesson hub, images, git history, proposals, moderation, notifications,
// profiles, the AI flow, the feeds. It reaches storage through the platform seam
// (src/platform/) and Postgres over HTTP, and touches no runtime global that
// isn't web-standard.
//
// What is NOT here is the handful of things that genuinely need Cloudflare: live
// collaboration, letterboard sessions and the remote MCP endpoint (all Durable
// Objects), crawler prerendering and og-image screenshots (Browser Rendering).
// The Worker entry registers those itself. A self-hosted instance does without them, which is why
// they are absent rather than stubbed — a stub would be a promise the host can't
// keep.
//
// Route order is load-bearing in two ways, and both are why registration is a
// function rather than a module-level side effect. Deeper paths must come before
// broader ones (`/lessons/:id/comments` before `/lessons/*`), and the frontend
// catch-all must come last — after whatever extra routes an entry adds, or it
// would swallow them. Hence `registerFrontend`, called by each entry once it has
// finished adding its own.
