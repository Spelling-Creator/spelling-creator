// The Workers half of `#image-codec-wasm` (see package.json's "imports" and

// wrangler resolves a `.wasm` import to an already-compiled `WebAssembly.Module`

// fallback of fetching the binary at runtime is not allowed.
//
// The functions are async only so that both halves of this module have the same
// signature; there is nothing to wait for here.
