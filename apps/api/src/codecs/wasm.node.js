// The Node half of `#image-codec-wasm` (see package.json's "imports" and
// ../imageConvert.js).
//
// Node has no wasm-module loader for imports, so each codec's binary is read off
// disk and compiled here. The result is the same `WebAssembly.Module` the
// Workers half gets from wrangler's bundler, so @jsquash's `init()` is handed
// the same thing on both hosts and never falls back to fetching the binary
// itself.
//
// Compiling is deferred and memoised rather than done at import time: the three
// binaries are about 700 KB together, and an instance that never receives an
// image upload should not pay for them at startup. A failed compile clears its
// slot so the next upload retries, matching how imageConvert.js treats a failed
// init.

// nothing rewrites, and it answers the same question.
