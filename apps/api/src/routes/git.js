// A lesson's version history, stored as a git packfile in R2.
//
// The editor keeps each lesson in a real git repository in the browser (one file
// per content block, named by its block id — see web/src/lib/git/). For someone
// else to *fork* a lesson, that repository has to travel, so the author uploads
// it here the way git itself moves history: as a packfile holding every object
// reachable from the lesson's branch, plus the commit its branch points at.
//
//   GET /git/:lessonId/refs   public* -> { head, refs, size, updatedAt } | 404
//   GET /git/:lessonId/pack   public* -> the packfile (X-Git-Head names its tip,
//                                        X-Git-Refs every branch it holds)
//   PUT /git/:lessonId/pack   Bearer   -> store it (the author, or a trusted collaborator)
//
// A pull request's proposed history is a packfile too, but it belongs to the
// request rather than to the lesson and lives under its own routes — see
// routes/pulls.js.
//
// *A private draft's (published = false) history is not public — only its
//  author, a trusted collaborator, or a moderator/admin may read it, same as
//  GET /lessons/:id.
//
// A forker downloads the pack, indexes it into their own object store, and holds
// a genuine clone: same commits, same oids, shared ancestry — which is what lets
// the two be merged later against their true common ancestor.
//
// Two R2 objects per lesson, mirroring the /images routes' use of the bucket:
//   git/<lessonId>/pack        the packfile bytes
//   git/<lessonId>/refs.json   { head, refs, size, updatedAt }
//
// The pack carries its own tip *and* its branch map in its object metadata (echoed in
// the X-Git-Head and X-Git-Refs response headers). A clone therefore reads both
// from the *same object* as the bytes, so it can never pair a new refs.json with
// a stale pack.
//
// ---- More than one branch ---------------------------------------------------
//
// `head` is the lesson: the default branch, and the only one a reader, a forker
// or the lesson's own page ever asks for. `refs` maps every branch the repository
// holds to its tip — one per *variation* its author is trying out, kept here so a
// variation follows the lesson between the author's devices rather than living
// only in the browser it was started in.
//
// A variation is exactly as public as the lesson it belongs to: it is in the same
// pack, and the pack of a published lesson is public so that forking is. See
// /web-app/lesson-variations, which says so where an author can read it.
//
// ---- Who may push, and why it can't lose work -------------------------------
//
// Two people can write a lesson's history: its author, and anyone the author put
// on the lesson's trusted-collaborator list. Nobody else — a forker cannot push
// into the lesson they forked, however much work they have done on it. What they
// can do is open a pull request and have one of those two merge it (see
// routes/pulls.js and /web-app/pull-requests); the merge commit is then pushed
// here by the reviewer, under their own credentials.
//
// The moment more than one writer exists, a plain "last write wins" would
// silently destroy history: whoever saved second would replace the other's
// commits with a pack that never contained them.
//
// So a push is a **compare-and-swap**. The client sends `X-Git-Parent`: the head
// it believes is current. If that isn't the head we hold, the push is rejected
// with 409 and the client must fetch, merge, and retry. Since the client only
// pushes a history that already *contains* the head it merged, an accepted push
// can only ever move the lesson forward.
//
// The same rule runs one level down for the variations, per branch:
//
//   X-Git-Refs      the branches to set, `{ "<name>": "<oid>" }`
//   X-Git-Expected  what the client believes we hold for each name it touches,
//                   with "" meaning "I believe this one does not exist yet"
//   X-Git-Deletes   the branches to remove, comma-separated
//
// It is all-or-nothing, which costs nothing to arrange: refs.json is a single
// object and already the commit point, so every branch advances or none does. A
// branch the client doesn't mention is left exactly as it is — that is what stops
// a device which has never heard of a new variation from deleting it by omission,
// and it is why a delete has to be asked for by name rather than inferred.
