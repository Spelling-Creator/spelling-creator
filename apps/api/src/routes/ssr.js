// Server-side rendering for the app's public read-only routes.
//
// /hub, /hub/:id and /users/:id are the pages whose primary content is a public
// JSON fetch, so the Worker can fetch it and render the real React tree before
// the browser has run a line of JavaScript. Everyone gets the rendered HTML —
// not just crawlers, which is what separates this from the Chromium prerender
// in render.js (that one still covers the routes listed below as not renderable).
//
// What this deliberately does NOT do is render anything personalised. The
// Supabase session lives in localStorage behind PKCE and is invisible to a
// server, so the render is always anonymous and the signed-in parts of the page
// fill in when the client hydrates. That is the property that makes SSR
// tractable here at all: every route worth rendering is a public read.
//
// Failure at request time is always soft: a failed data fetch or a render error
// falls through to the static SPA shell, which is exactly what the app served
// before this route existed. A *missing* server bundle is not a runtime case at
// all — the import below is static, so the Worker fails to bundle, which is why
// every script that reaches wrangler builds it first.

// them in that order.

// shared by the code that renders one and the code that decides it is a page at
// all.
//
// Matching a lesson's *tabs* is not optional. The service worker's
// navigateFallback denylist excludes the whole of /hub/* from the precached shell
// (WORKER_PATHS in apps/web/vite.config.js), on the grounds that the Worker
// answers those paths itself. If LESSON_PATH stopped at /hub/:id, a tab would be
// excluded from the shell *and* unmatched here: online it would fall through to
// the SPA shell and still work, but offline — where there is no Worker to fall
// through to — it would fail outright. The two lists have to agree.
