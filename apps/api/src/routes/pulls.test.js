// What an upload to a proposal is allowed to do.
//
// A proposal used to be write-once, which made this decision trivial and made
// changing a proposal impossible. Now it has three outcomes — complete the open,
// record a new revision, or refuse — and getting the refusals wrong is how a
// reviewer ends up reading one thing and merging another. Pure, so tested here
// rather than through R2.
