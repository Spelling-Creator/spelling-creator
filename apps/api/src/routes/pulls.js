// Pull requests: proposing changes to a lesson you don't own.
//
// Anyone may fork a published lesson, but nobody may write someone else's lesson
// from their fork. To offer work back, a forker opens a pull request against the
// lesson; the lesson's author — or one of the trusted collaborators they named —
// reviews it and merges it in. Everything a proposal needs to survive that round
// trip is captured when it is opened, so nothing moves under the reviewer.
//
//   GET  /lessons/:id/pulls                 public* -> { pulls: PullRequest[] }
//   POST /lessons/:id/pulls                 Bearer  -> { pull }            (anyone but the author)
//   PUT  /lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/pack      Bearer  -> { pull }           (the proposer; the packfile)
//   GET  /lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/pack      public* -> the packfile        (X-Git-Head names its tip)
//   POST /lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/merge     Bearer  -> { pull }            (author or trusted collaborator)
//   POST /lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/close     Bearer  -> { pull }            (proposer, author, trusted, moderator)
//
// *Reads follow the lesson's own visibility (lib/lesson.js canReadLesson): a
//  proposal against a public lesson is public, like a comment on it, and one
//  against a private draft is as private as the draft.
//
// ---- What a pull request holds ----------------------------------------------
//
// The changes themselves are a git packfile — the proposer's whole repository,
// snapshotted at the moment they opened the request and stored in R2 under
// git/pulls/<id>/pack (see lib/lessonGit.js). Because a fork is a genuine clone,
// that pack shares object ids with the lesson's own history, so the reviewer's
// merge is a real three-way merge against the commit the two actually diverged
// from — not a guess.
//
// Snapshotting is deliberate: the proposer carries on editing their fork, and a
// request that silently tracked their branch would mean the reviewer approving
// one thing and merging another.
//
// Opening a request is therefore two steps — insert the row, then upload the
// pack against its id — and a row is `ready` only once the pack has landed. An
// unready request has nothing to review, so it is shown only to the person who
// opened it, who can withdraw it and try again.
//
// ---- Who may merge, and what "merged" means ---------------------------------
//
// Only the lesson's author or a trusted collaborator may merge, and merging is
// not a write of content: the merge happens in the reviewer's own editor, is
// pushed to the lesson's history through PUT /git/:lessonId/pack under their
// credentials, and only *then* is the request marked merged here. This endpoint
// verifies that claim rather than believing it — the merge commit the client
// names must be the head the lesson's stored history now actually points at. So
// "merged" can't be set on a request whose changes were never landed.

 * This used to be a once-only write, so that a reviewer could not have the

 * the consequence was that changing a proposal meant closing it and opening a new
 * one, which threw away the conversation attached to it.
 *
 * So an upload to an already-ready proposal is allowed, and *recorded*: the
 * revision number goes up, the head it used to point at is kept, and the row's

 * are shown that it changed, and what the change was. The stability that mattered
 * was never immutability, it was that nothing moves without saying so.
 *
 * One pack per proposal, not one per revision. The proposer's branch only moves
 * forward, so the commit the previous revision pointed at is still reachable in
 * the new pack — which is what lets "what changed in this update" be answered
 * from the pack we already store.
 *
 * That forward-only rule is enforced by the client, not here: verifying it means
 * walking the commit graph, and this Worker holds a proposal's history as an
 * opaque packfile with no filesystem to index one into — the same limit that
 * stops the merge endpoint checking ancestry (see mergePull below). The exposure
 * is bounded the same way, too: the only proposal a proposer can rewrite is their
 * own, which they could always have closed and reopened instead.

 * POST /lessons/:id/pulls/:prId/merge — record that a proposal has been merged.

 * what's left is to mark the request resolved.
 *
 * ---- What this actually proves, and what it doesn't ------------------------
 *
 * `mergeCommit` must be the commit the lesson's stored history now points at.
 * That is checked rather than believed, and it rules out the failure that
 * matters in practice: a client marking proposals merged while dropping them on
 * the floor, leaving a lesson whose record of what happened to it is fiction.
 * A lesson with no stored history at all can't have been merged into, so that's
 * refused too — the reviewer's own push is what puts the history there.
 *
 * What it does *not* prove is that the commit it names descends from this
 * particular proposal. Establishing that means walking the commit graph, and the
 * Worker holds the history as an opaque packfile — it has no filesystem to index
 * one into, so it cannot read the ancestry. A reviewer could therefore merge
 * proposal A and record proposal B against it.
 *
 * That gap is bounded by who can reach it: only the lesson's author and the
 * collaborators they trust, who can already rewrite the lesson however they
 * like, and who can simply close a proposal they don't want. So the exposure is
 * a mislabelled record, not a way in. And nothing is destroyed by it — the
 * proposal's pack is kept (see below), so a merge recorded in error can be read
 * back and settled properly.
