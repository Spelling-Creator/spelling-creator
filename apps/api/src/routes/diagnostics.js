// Two endpoints about the health of the instance itself.
//
//   GET /_health       Is this process up? Public, cheap, answers nothing else.
//   GET /_diagnostics  Is each dependency working, and if not, why? Gated.
//
// They are separate because they answer different questions for different
// audiences. A load balancer wants a fast yes/no about the process and should
// not be taking the database down with it when Postgres hiccups; a person
// debugging wants everything, and is willing to authenticate for it.
//
// The gate on /_diagnostics is the same X-Admin-Token the backfills use. The
// results carry no credentials, but they do carry upstream error messages that
// can name tables and buckets, and that is not something to hand to anyone who
// asks. When no token is configured the endpoint refuses rather than opening —
// an instance with no admin token is not thereby more public.
//
// The same checks run at startup and print to the log (see node/server.js), so
// being locked out of this endpoint never leaves an operator with no way to see
// what is wrong.
