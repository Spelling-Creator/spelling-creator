// server-rendered HTML for the public read routes, against Postgres over
// PostgREST and an S3-compatible object store. What it does not serve is the
// three things that need Cloudflare specifically: live collaboration and the
// remote MCP endpoint (Durable Objects), and crawler prerendering plus og-image
// screenshots (Browser Rendering). See /monorepo/self-hosting for what that
// costs in practice — briefly, the MCP server still works over stdio, and SSR
// already covers the pages a crawler cares about.
//
// Configuration is environment variables and nothing else, listed in
// src/node/platform.js and in the docs. The process is stateless: run as many as
// you like behind a proxy.
