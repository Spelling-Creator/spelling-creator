// The static-asset server, standing in for Cloudflare's `env.ASSETS` binding.
//
// The Worker serves the built SPA (and the docs site inside it) from an asset
// bundle uploaded alongside the code, reached through `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)`
// with `not_found_handling: "none"`. This is the same contract over a directory
// on disk, so `handleFrontend` and the SSR path (which fetches /index.html
// through it) work unchanged.
//
// Note what this deliberately does *not* do: substitute index.html for a path
// with no file behind it. A deep link like /hub/abc does still resolve to the
// shell — but that decision belongs to routes/spa.js, which knows the app's route
// table and can tell /hub/abc from /nonsense. Here, missing is missing.
//
// A production deployment will usually put a reverse proxy in front of this and
// let it serve the directory directly, which is faster and handles ranges and
// compression properly. This exists so that a deployment doesn't *have* to: one
// process, one port, and it works.
