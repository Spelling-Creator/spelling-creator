// Ask every dependency whether it is actually working, and say precisely what
// is wrong when it isn't.
//
// This exists because of how the first self-hosted deployment went. Every
// failure surfaced far from its cause and looked like every other failure: a
// stale PostgREST schema cache, an unapplied schema, a missing bucket and a
// misconfigured admin role all present to a user as one identical opaque 502,
// and to an operator as an app that starts fine and then doesn't work. Each one
// took a round trip to guess at.
//
// The checks below are written against the failures that actually happened, and
// each is chosen to distinguish causes rather than to confirm health. Reaching
// PostgREST is not the same as PostgREST being able to see the tables; reaching
// GoTrue is not the same as being allowed to call its admin API; a bucket that
// answers is not the same as a bucket that exists.
//
// Two rules for what goes in a result. It never contains a credential, and it
// always contains the upstream's own words — a status code and, where there is
// one, the error code the upstream uses for that condition (PostgREST's PGRST205
// or S3's NoSuchBucket). Those are the strings worth searching for, and
// paraphrasing them helps nobody.
