// Rich text — the Worker's write-side sanitizer for the two places users author
// formatted content: lesson comments and profile bios. Both are written in the
// browser with tiptap (see apps/web/src/components/RichTextInput.jsx) and stored
// as HTML.
//
// HTML arriving from a browser is untrusted: the editor's toolbar is a suggestion,
// not a boundary, and anyone can POST hand-written HTML straight at the Worker. So
// every write path runs the value through `sanitizeRichText` here, which is the
// single authority on what may be stored. It is an allow-list — anything not named
// in RICH_TEXT_TAGS is dropped — so a tag we've never thought of fails closed.
//
// Two properties this file is responsible for:
//
//   1. No stored XSS. The render path (apps/web/src/components/RichText.jsx) injects
//      this HTML with dangerouslySetInnerHTML, so a surviving <script>, an onerror=
//      attribute or a javascript: href would execute in a reader's session. Every
//      attribute is stripped except a validated href.
//   2. No embedded media. Product rule: users may format text, but may not upload or
//      embed images, video, audio or frames. The editor simply has no such buttons,
//      but that only stops honest clients — DROP_TAGS is what actually enforces it,
//      including for media smuggled in as a data: URI.
//
// Parsing uses parse5, a WHATWG-conformant HTML parser. Using a real parser is the
// non-negotiable part: it sees the same tag soup a browser would, whereas a
// regex-based "sanitizer" is the classic way to ship an XSS hole (`<img/src=x
// onerror=...>`, `<scr<script>ipt>`, and so on).
//
// It used to be HTMLRewriter, the Workers runtime's own streaming parser. parse5
// replaced it for one reason: it runs in every runtime, and HTMLRewriter runs in
// one. A self-hosted instance would otherwise need a second sanitizer, and two
// implementations of a security boundary that have to agree is a worse thing to own
// than a dependency — the drift would be silent, and it would be an XSS hole. The
// browser's render-time DOMPurify pass stays as it is: that one is defence in depth
// against rows written by an older Worker, not a second copy of this policy.
//
// The policy itself — the allow-list, the link schemes, what a link is rewritten to
// carry, and the flattening to plain text — is shared with the browser's render-time
// pass in @spelling-creator/core/richText. Only the parser is per-runtime, and now
// it need not even be that.
