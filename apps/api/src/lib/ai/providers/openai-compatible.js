// Any server that speaks the OpenAI chat-completions API — which is to say, the
// self-hosted option.
//
// Ollama, llama.cpp's server, vLLM, LM Studio, LiteLLM, text-generation-webui and
// a dozen hosted gateways all expose this shape, so one provider covers all of
// them. It is the AI story for an instance that has neither a hosted API key nor
// Cloudflare's Workers AI binding, and it is the only provider here where the
// model can run on the same machine as the app.
//
// Configured entirely by environment, because the whole point is that we don't
// know what it is:
//
//   OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_URL      required; the base URL, e.g. http://ollama:11434/v1
//   OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODELS   required; comma-separated, tried in order
//   OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY  optional; most local runtimes want no auth
//   OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_JSON     optional; 'schema' for servers that enforce one
//
// The default for structured output is the weaker `json_object` mode, with the
// shape described in the prompt — the same thing the Groq provider does, for the
// same reason. Whether a server honours `json_schema` depends on which runtime it
// is and which version, and a wrong guess here fails every question suggestion
// with a 400. An operator who knows their server enforces schemas gets the
// stricter behaviour by setting OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_JSON=schema.
