// Where a lesson's packed version history lives in the object store, and how to
// remove it.
//
// The editor keeps each lesson in a real git repository in the browser (one file
// per content block — see web/src/lib/git/). For someone else to fork a lesson,
// that repository travels as a packfile, which the author uploads and we store
// here. Two objects per lesson:
//
//   git/<lessonId>/pack        the packfile bytes
//   git/<lessonId>/refs.json   { head, refs, size, updatedAt }
//
// `head` is the lesson itself — the default branch — and `refs` maps every branch
// the repository holds to its tip, one per *variation* its author is trying out
// (see /docs/developers/web-app/variations). `head` came first and is kept as its own
// field rather than being read out of the map: everything that wants "the
// lesson" wants exactly that one branch, and a reader written before variations
// existed still gets the right answer from it.
//
// A pull request — someone proposing changes to a lesson they don't own — is a
// packfile too, snapshotted when the request was opened, under its own key:
//
//   git/pulls/<pullRequestId>/pack
//
// It needs no refs.json: a pull request's tip is fixed at the moment it is
// opened and recorded on its database row, so there is nothing to advertise
// separately. (The head still rides along in the object's metadata, so a
// reader gets bytes and tip from one object, as for a lesson.)
//
// The routes that read and write them are in routes/git.js and routes/pulls.js.
// This module holds only the key layout and the deletes, so the lesson-delete
// paths (routes/lessons.js and lib/lesson.js) can clean a lesson's history up
// without a route importing a route.
