// BlobStore — the object-storage interface this API stores lesson images and
// lesson-history packfiles through.
//
// It is deliberately the intersection of R2 and S3 rather than either one: five
// methods, no multipart, no conditional writes, no presigning, no ACLs. Both
// stores here are content-addressed or author-owned and written whole, so
// nothing needs more than this — and keeping it this small is what lets an S3
// adapter (MinIO, Garage, Ceph, AWS) be a couple of hundred lines.
//
// The shapes below are normalised away from R2's own vocabulary. R2 hands back
// `httpMetadata.contentType`, `httpEtag` and `customMetadata`; S3 hands back
// `ContentType`, `ETag` and `Metadata`. Neither name appears in route code —
// they see `contentType`, `etag` and `metadata`.
//
// This file is types and documentation only; the implementations live beside it.

 * Keys are opaque here — any text, slashes included, which is what lets them be
 * `git/<lessonId>/pack` — with one exception, and it is a correctness rule
 * rather than a matter of taste. An S3 store addresses an object by URL path,
 * and a URL resolves `.` and `..` segments before the request is ever signed:
 * `git/../images/x` would be sent, and stored, as `images/x`, and a key starting
 * `../` would leave the bucket altogether. R2 takes the same key verbatim and
 * stores it exactly as given. So a key with a dot segment means two different
 * objects depending on which host is running, which is precisely the divergence
 * this seam exists to prevent — and on the path-based host it is a way to write
 * somewhere the caller did not name.
 *
 * Nothing in this API produces such a key: they are content hashes and
 * UUID-shaped paths. This is here so that the day something does, it fails
 * loudly at the call rather than quietly at the wrong object.
