// A KvStore over Postgres, reached through PostgREST.
//
// The replacement for Cloudflare KV when self-hosting: rate-limit buckets, the
// AI answer cache, and MCP OAuth pending state, in a `(key, value, expires_at)`
// table.
//
// Through PostgREST rather than through `pg` on purpose. Every other thing this
// API reads or writes already goes over PostgREST with the service-role key, so
// this needs no new dependency, no connection pool, and no second set of
// credentials to configure — and it keeps working in the Workers runtime, which
// cannot open a raw TCP connection to Postgres at all. A direct-SQL adapter can
// be written later behind the same interface if the extra hop ever matters; for
// a store whose callers already accepted an eventually-consistent KV, it does
// not.
//
// Expiry is enforced on read rather than by the database, because PostgREST
// offers no TTL and the alternative — depending on pg_cron being installed —
// would make a self-host fail in a way that looks like a rate limiter that never
// resets. A row past its expiry reads as absent and is swept on the way past;
// see `get` below, and the periodic sweep in schema.sql for the rows nobody ever
// asks for again.
