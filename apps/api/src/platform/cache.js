// ResponseCache — the HTTP response cache in front of the expensive reads.
//
// Three things use it: immutable image bytes (so a public lesson view doesn't
// cost an object-store read per visitor), crawler prerender snapshots (which
// cost a headless browser), and link-preview cards (which cost a lesson fetch
// and a render). All three are keyed by a URL string and hold a whole Response.
//
// Cloudflare's `caches.default` keys entries by `Request`, which is a Workers
// shape — so this interface keys by string instead, and the Cloudflare adapter
// builds the Request itself. That's the only reason this interface exists rather
// than route code touching `caches.default`: a string key is something any host
// can implement, including by not caching at all.
//
// Every method is best-effort. A cache that fails, or that stores nothing, must
// never change what a handler returns — only how much work it did to get there.
//
// This file documents the interface and provides the no-op implementation.

 * @property {(key: string, response: Response) => Promise<void>} put
 *   Cache a response. The caller passes a clone it no longer needs; honouring
