// AWS Signature Version 4, over WebCrypto and fetch.
//
// This exists so the S3 blob store can be a few hundred lines of `fetch` rather
// than a dependency on `@aws-sdk/client-s3`. That trade is worth making twice
// over: the SDK is tens of megabytes and assumes Node, where signing is a page
// of well-specified arithmetic that runs unchanged in workerd, in Node, and in
// a browser — every runtime this API might one day be hosted on has SHA-256 and
// HMAC in `crypto.subtle`.
//
// The signature covers the method, the path, the query, a chosen set of headers,
// and a hash of the body. Getting any of that canonicalisation subtly wrong
// produces a signature that is wrong for *some* requests and right for others —
// a key with a space in it, a query string in the wrong order — which is the
// worst possible failure mode. So the algorithm is implemented from the spec and
// checked against AWS's own published examples in sigv4.test.js, including the
// intermediate canonical request and string-to-sign, not only the final digest.
//
// Only what S3 needs is here: header-based (not query/presigned) authorization,
// single-chunk signed payloads, no session-token edge cases beyond passing one
// through.
