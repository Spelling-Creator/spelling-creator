// KvStore — the expiring key-value interface behind the rate limiters, the AI
// answer cache, and the MCP OAuth pending-authorization state.
//
// Three methods, string values, one option. Every value this API keeps in KV is
// small, JSON-or-number, and has a TTL after which its absence is the correct
// answer — a spent rate-limit bucket, a cached suggestion, an abandoned consent
// flow. Nothing here is authoritative, which is why it can live in Cloudflare KV
// (eventually consistent) at all, and equally why a `(key, value, expires_at)`
// table in the Postgres the instance already runs is a complete replacement.
//
// Deliberately absent: list, atomic increment, compare-and-set. The rate limiters
// are read-modify-write token buckets that tolerate a lost update (the worst case
// is one extra request served), and nothing else mutates a shared key. An adapter
// therefore never needs a transaction.
//
// This file is types and documentation only; the implementations live beside it.
