// A BlobStore over any S3-compatible object store — MinIO, Garage, Ceph RGW,
// SeaweedFS, Backblaze B2, AWS itself.
//
// Built on `fetch` and the SigV4 signer next door rather than on
// `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, for the reasons set out in sigv4.js: the SDK is tens of
// megabytes and Node-shaped, where this is a few hundred lines that run
// unchanged in workerd, Node and anything else with `fetch` and `crypto.subtle`.
// Only five operations are needed, and none of them is complicated.
//
// Path-style addressing is the default (`http://host:9000/bucket/key`), because
// that is what a self-hosted MinIO or Garage serves out of the box and
// virtual-host style would need wildcard DNS. AWS wants the other one, so it is
// an option.
//
// Two places where S3 and R2 genuinely differ, both handled here so route code
// never learns about them:
//
//   * S3 object metadata rides in `x-amz-meta-*` headers, which are ASCII-only
//     by specification. R2's customMetadata takes arbitrary strings. So values
//     are percent-encoded on the way out and decoded on the way in, which makes
//     the round trip lossless without depending on a server tolerating bytes it
//     was never promised.
//
//   * A ListObjectsV2 response carries keys, sizes and ETags but NOT content
//     types, where R2's listing does. The BlobStore contract says a listing
//     carries content types (the WEBP backfill filters on them), so this adapter
//     pays for that with a HEAD per listed object — see list() for why that's
//     the right trade rather than weakening the contract.
