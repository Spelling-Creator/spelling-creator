// The platform seam — the boundary between this API's logic and the services it
// stores things in.
//
// Everything the Worker keeps outside of Postgres lives behind one of three tiny
// interfaces defined here: a blob store, a key-value store with expiry, and a
// response cache. Route code asks for them *by role* ("the image store", "the
// rate limiter") rather than by binding name, so the same handlers run against
// Cloudflare's R2/KV/Cache API or against S3-compatible object storage and a
// Postgres table without knowing which.
//
// This exists for self-hosting. The hosted instance runs on Cloudflare and will
// keep doing so; but R2, KV and `caches.default` are the only pieces of this API
// with no standard equivalent, and each is used through a handful of methods.
// Naming that handful is the difference between "portable" and "rewrite".
//
// Adding a host means writing one module that returns the shape below — see
// cloudflare.js for the reference implementation, and the interface docs in
// blobs.js / kv.js / cache.js for what each method must do.
//
//   platform(env) -> {
//     images,          BlobStore | null   lesson images, keyed by content hash
//     lessonGit,       BlobStore | null   lesson history packfiles
//     rateLimit,       KvStore   | null   rate-limit buckets + the AI answer cache
//     oauthState,      KvStore   | null   short-lived MCP OAuth authorization state
//     cache,           ResponseCache      HTTP response cache (never null; may no-op)
//     federationKv,    Fedify KvStore | null       ActivityPub caches (remote actors, keys, idempotence)
//     federationQueue, Fedify MessageQueue | null  outgoing deliveries (null = send at once)
//     clientIp(request) -> string
//   }
//
// A store is null when its backing service isn't configured, which callers
// already check for — an instance without an image bucket serves everything
// else. `cache` is the exception: a host with no cache returns the no-op cache
// (see cache.js), because "don't cache" is always a valid answer.
//
// The two federation entries are Fedify's own interfaces rather than the seam's,
// because Fedify is the one reading them (see lib/federation/). They sit here
// for the same reason as the rest: which store backs them is the host's
// business, and the hosted instance and a self-hosted one answer differently.
