// some of the code under test only exists there.
//
// That used to include the rich-text sanitizer, which was built on HTMLRewriter; it
// parses with parse5 now and would run anywhere. What still pins this to workerd is
// the platform adapters — src/platform/cloudflare.test.js runs the conformance suite
// against real R2 and KV, and a Node-shaped fake of those would only assert our own
// assumptions back at us.
//
// The same goes double for CollabRoom: it's a Durable Object holding the live session's
// Yjs document in SQLite and handing it to late joiners, so the only test worth having
// runs it as a real Durable Object. `main` points at a test-only entry exporting just
// that class (see src/collab-room.test-worker.js) — the production entry would drag in
// Puppeteer and the whole route table for no benefit.
