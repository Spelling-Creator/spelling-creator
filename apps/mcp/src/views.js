// The server half of the MCP Apps views — the `ui://` resources a host fetches
// and renders in a sandboxed iframe beside a tool's result. See
// apps/docs/docs/mcp-server/interactive-views.md for the design, and views/ for
// the source the built HTML comes from.
//
// Views are a progressive enhancement, and deliberately the only optional part
// of this server: a host that doesn't negotiate the MCP Apps capability
// (io.modelcontextprotocol/ui) never reads these resources and gets exactly the
// text results it always did. Registration doesn't branch on the capability —
// the `_meta.ui` a tool carries is inert to a host that doesn't look for it, so
// registering unconditionally costs a client that can't render anything nothing
// at all, and keeps one code path instead of two.
//
// What a tool *says* does branch, through `rendersViews()` below: when the user
// is about to be shown a choice, telling the model to make that choice anyway
// is worse than saying nothing. See its comment for why that one branch is
// worth having.
//
// The HTML reaches both runtimes the same way standards.md does — a package
// subpath import resolved per-runtime (see package.json's "imports"), because
// wrangler's Text module rule matches on a literal relative specifier and Node
// has no text-module loader at all.

/**
 * Whether the connected host will actually put this server's views on screen —
 * it negotiated the MCP Apps extension, and renders the mime type the views are
 * served under.
 *
 * A tool with a view asks this before it writes to the model, because the same
 * result means two different things on the two paths. In a text client the model
 * IS the one choosing, and a list of candidates with "pick one" is exactly right.
 * In a host that renders the picker, the user is choosing, from pictures the
 * model cannot see — so the same words make the assistant race ahead and add an
 * image itself, and the picker it just talked over becomes a list of things the
 * user is too late to want. The rendered path has to be told to stop instead.
 *
 * It has a second job, for the tools only a view is supposed to call
 * (merge_proposal, decline_proposal — `visibility: ["app"]`). A host that never
 * drew the view cannot have had a button pressed in it, so a call arriving from
 * one can only be the model on a host that ignored the visibility metadata, and
 * those tools refuse it. `false` is the safe answer there too, by luck rather
 * than design: the cost of being wrong is a merge the reviewer has to do in the
 * web app instead, which is where it happened until now anyway.
 *
 * Only known once the client has initialised, and only as truthfully as the
 * client declares it — so when the answer is less than certain, it is `false`.
 * The two ways of being wrong cost very different things. Saying "text" to a
 * host that does render leaves the old bug: the assistant picks an image over
 * the user's picker, which is rude but recoverable in one sentence — "no, use
 * the other one". Saying "renders" to a host that doesn't ends the assistant's
 * turn to wait for a click on a picker that was never drawn, and nothing will
 * ever arrive: the conversation simply stops, with no clue why. The stall is the
 * worse of the two by a long way, so anything short of the host plainly saying
 * it renders this mime type takes the text path.
 *
 * @param {import('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js').McpServer} server
