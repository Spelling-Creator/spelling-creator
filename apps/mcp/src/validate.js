// Lesson-standard validation — the mechanically checkable half of the authoring
// standard stated in standards.md.
//
// The split between the two files is deliberate. standards.md carries the rules
// that need judgement ("a tight open must be answerable instantly"), and it only
// reaches the model if the client surfaces server instructions or tool
// descriptions. This module decides the rules a script can decide on its own, on
// the way into a write, so they hold even when the model never read a word of the
// standard.
//
// Errors reject the write; warnings ride along with a successful one. The line
// between them is whether a legitimate lesson could ever trip the check: a green
// answer that is not in its own passage is always a defect, whereas a five-section
// lesson is usually a mistake and occasionally exactly what the user asked for.
// `skipValidation: true` on the writing tools turns the errors off for the rare
// case where the user genuinely wants something the standard forbids.
//
// Every message names the section, the offending value, and the fix, because the
// model reads the rejection and resubmits: "validation failed" buys a guess, a
// specific message buys a correction in one round trip.
