// The tools that put an assistant into a live collaboration session.
//
// These are registered only on a transport that can hold a socket open between
// tool calls — stdio, in practice. The remote (Worker) transport builds a fresh
// McpServer per request and has nowhere to keep a session, so registerTools
// leaves them out there rather than advertising tools that could never work.
//
// One session at a time, held in this closure. An assistant with two sessions
// open has no way to say which one it means, and the room caps a session at ten
// participants anyway; the tools all speak about "the session" for that reason.
//
// The session client itself is collab.js — this file is the MCP surface over it:
// schemas, the authoring standard, and results written for a model that cannot
// see the teacher's screen.
