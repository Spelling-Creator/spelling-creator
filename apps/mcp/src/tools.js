// Tool definitions for the Spelling Creator MCP server.
//
// This module is transport-agnostic: `registerTools(server, ctx)` attaches every
// tool to a given MCP `server`, whether that server is wired to stdio (local CLI,
// see stdio.js) or to a Streamable-HTTP handler running inside the Worker (remote,
// see worker.js). `ctx` carries the API client and resolved config.
//
// The connected AI assistant writes the lesson content; these tools just give it
// a structured, validated path from "here is the lesson I composed" to a row in
// the hub — reusing the Worker's own validation, author attribution, and ban
// checks (we never set the author; the Worker derives it from the token).
