// Committing an assistant's edits into a lesson's version history
// (recordLessonHistory in src/git.js), against the fake hub.
//
// The hub keeps a lesson's document and a lesson's repository in two separate
// stores, and saving the document writes only the first. So every one of these
// asks the same question from a different angle: after the tool has saved, does
// the lesson's History tab actually say what happened? Before this existed it
// said nothing at all, however much an assistant had rewritten.
//
// Forking and proposing are tested in fork.test.js.
