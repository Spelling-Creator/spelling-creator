// Forking a lesson and proposing changes back (src/git.js), against a fake hub.
//
// The point of these is the git, not the HTTP: the fake hub (test/fake-hub.js)
// stores packfiles the way the Worker's R2 bucket does, with the same
// compare-and-swap on write, so what's under test is whether the repository the
// assistant builds is a real clone — whether the proposal's pack shares ancestry
// with the lesson it targets. Without that a reviewer's three-way merge has no
// base and the whole flow degrades to "replace the lesson with mine".
//
// Committing an ordinary edit (recordLessonHistory) is tested in history.test.js,
// and the in-memory filesystem these repositories are built on in
// packages/core/src/git/memfs.test.ts.
