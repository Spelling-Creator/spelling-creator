// The content column every page inside AppShell renders into.
//
// It exists because "the content column" had drifted into five different
// things: max-w-3xl, max-w-5xl and max-w-6xl across the pages, pt-6 or pt-12 at
// the top, pb-16 or pb-24 or nothing at the bottom. None of that variation
// meant anything — it was just whatever each page was written with — and it
// showed as pages that didn't line up with each other as you moved between
// them.
//
// There are two widths, and the difference between them is real:
//
//   wide     — listings, dashboards, and a lesson with its side rail. 64rem.
//   reading  — prose people actually read or write: comments, a proposal's
//              description, a commit list. 48rem, because a line of text set to
//              the full width of a desktop screen is harder to read, not
//              easier. This is why the page getting wider did NOT make the
//              lesson text wider.
//
// Anything that needs neither (the marketing hero's full-bleed gradient, the
// editor's panes) doesn't use this and says why where it opts out.
