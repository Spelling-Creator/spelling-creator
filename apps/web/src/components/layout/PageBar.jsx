// The sticky bar at the top of every page inside AppShell. It replaces
// AppHeader, and it is deliberately much less than AppHeader was.
//
// The old bar was the app's --primary surface: a block of indigo carrying the
// page title *and* the whole of the app's navigation. Now that AppSidebar holds
// the navigation, a second heavy surface would just compete with it — two
// things both claiming to be the app's chrome. So this one sits on the page
// background, keeps only the glass blur, and carries three things: the sidebar
// toggle, where you are, and what you can do here.
//
// Height still comes from --header-row-h / --header-h in globals.css, which
// remain the single source of truth — the editor's sticky section headers pin
// to them and anything scrolled to programmatically offsets by them. See
// docs/web-app/navigating-large-lessons.md.
