// "Your answers" — the signed-in reader's own saved run-throughs of this lesson,
// from interactive mode (InteractiveLesson.jsx).
//
// This panel is only ever rendered for the person who wrote the answers. The
// Worker scopes every read to the verified caller (see the privacy note in
// apps/api/src/routes/lessonResponses.js), so there is no version of this
// component that could show someone else's work even if it were asked to — not
// for the lesson's author, not for a moderator. It renders nothing at all when
// signed out, and nothing when the reader has never worked through this lesson,
// so it never advertises a feature by leaving an empty box on the page.
//
// The server guarantee only covers what arrives; what's already in hand is this
// component's problem. A browser is a shared object — one reader signs out and
// another signs in, with no reload in between — so the loaded answers are held
// together with the id of the user they were fetched for, and what's rendered is
// derived from that pairing rather than from arrival order alone. See the state
// below.
