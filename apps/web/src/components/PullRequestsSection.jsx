// Proposed changes to a lesson: the body of its Proposals tab.
//
// Anyone can fork a lesson, but nobody can write someone else's. To offer work
// back you open a pull request from your fork (the editor's "Propose changes to
// …"), and it lands here — publicly, like a comment, so a lesson's history of
// contributions is visible rather than happening in private.
//
// Who can do what, from this list:
//
//   anyone signed in       nothing but read
//   the person who opened  withdraw their own proposal
//   the lesson's author    review & merge, or decline
//   a trusted collaborator the same as the author (they're who the author trusts
//                          with this lesson — see the collaboration dialog)
//   a moderator            close it, as with any other user-submitted text
//
// "Review & merge" doesn't merge anything here: it opens the lesson in the
// editor with the proposal in hand, because the merge is a real three-way merge
// against the lesson's git history and that lives in the editor (see
// EditorPage's pull-request review effect). What arrives is the usual block-by-
// block merge dialog, and nothing is written until it's confirmed.
