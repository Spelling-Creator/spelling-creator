// What the editor's document column holds while Preview is on: the lesson as a
// reader sees it, and nothing else.
//
// It is only the column's *contents*. The page wrapper, the section outline and
// the column itself stay in EditorPage and are the same elements in both modes,
// which is the point — an earlier version of this had preview build its own
// wrapper and column beside the editing one, and the two immediately disagreed
// about their width, so on a page column past ~1400px toggling preview silently
// made the lesson wider than the thing it was previewing. Two class strings
// meant to stay equal will not stay equal. One element can't drift from itself.
//
// No outline of its own for the same reason (EditorPage passes `readOnly` to the
// one that is already there), and nothing here is editable: no drag handles, no
// move buttons, no add-section FAB — see the FAB's own guard in EditorPage.
