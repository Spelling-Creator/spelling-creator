// once for the whole app through <ParticlesProvider>, whose `init` callback must
// be a stable module-level reference (the provider throws if it changes between
// renders) — hence `initEngine` lives at module scope. We load only the slim
// preset plus the two extra plugins this effect needs: the "text" shape (renders
// each particle as a word) and the emitters plugin (spawns words at the bottom).
