// Three places ask: a commit in the version history, a proposal's own page, and
// (through the first) a restore preview. They were never going to stay in step as
// three copies, and "what changed" is exactly the thing a reader compares between
// views — a proposal that reads differently from the commit it becomes would be
// worse than no summary at all.
//
// Both pieces take ops in the shape ops.ts produces, and neither needs git: the
// operations are already derived by the time they get here, which is what lets
// the proposal page draw this without the engine loaded.
