// The history tab (/hub/:id/history): the lesson's published commit timeline.
//
// This is the one tab that isn't a moved dialog. The editor's HistoryDialog
// reads the repository in *your* browser — the one your own edits are being
// committed to — and a reader of someone else's lesson has no such repository.
// So this one downloads the published packfile (GET /git/:lessonId/pack, see
// apps/api/src/routes/git.js), indexes it, and reads the log out of that.
//
// This tab shows the *published* history, and getting that right is subtler
// than it first looks. An earlier version cloned into the repo id the editor
// uses for the same lesson and then read that repository's local branch, on the
// reasoning that a lesson's history is one history and the clone may as well be
// shared. It isn't one history: the editor commits locally on every pause, and
// only a save pushes. So for anyone who had the lesson open in the editor, this
// public tab showed their own unpublished commits — and went stale the moment
// the published head moved on without them. (Caught in review on #40.)
//
// So the objects are still shared — they are content-addressed, and
// re-downloading a pack we already hold is pure waste — but the *ref* is not.
// The published tip is recorded at ORIGIN_REF, never at the local branch, and
// the log is read from that oid. Two consequences worth keeping:
//
//   - Nothing here can clobber editor work. cloneFromPack force-writes
//     refs/heads/main; fetchRemotePack writes only the remote ref.
//   - The head always comes from the same response as the bytes. /refs is asked
//     first because it is cheap, but if the pack has to be downloaded its own
//     X-Git-Head wins — the author replaces the pack in place, so a ref fetched
//     a moment earlier can name a commit those bytes don't contain.
//
// The route is lazy (see App.jsx): isomorphic-git and LightningFS are ~200 KB
// that nobody reading a lesson should download, so the engine is fetched
// through loadGitEngine() only once this tab is actually opened.
//
// A lesson published before histories were stored has no pack at all, which is
// not an error — it just has no timeline to show yet.
