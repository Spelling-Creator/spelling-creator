      {/* Two panes: the section outline and the document. The outline appears
          once there is room for it and drops away when there isn't — it is
          extra room to spend, not a layout the editor depends on.

          Preview does not get a layout of its own. It is the same wrapper, the
          same outline and the same column, holding different contents — so the
          two modes cannot disagree about their bounds, and toggling swaps what
          is in the page rather than rebuilding the page around you. (They did
          disagree, briefly: preview built a column of its own with a different
          width cap from the editing column's, and past ~1400px of page column
          it drew the lesson wider than the editor it was standing in for. Two
          class strings meant to stay equal do not stay equal; one element
          cannot drift from itself.)

          "Room" is measured against AppShell's @container/page, not the
          viewport, and that distinction is what lets the editor use the same
          sidebar as every other page. The sidebar is 16rem open and 3rem
          collapsed, so the space the editor actually has is not a function of
          the window's width; keyed off the container, collapsing the sidebar
          hands the panes its 13rem the instant you do it. The editor used to
          get its own permanently-collapsed sidebar to dodge this, which bought
          the room at the price of the app having two different sidebars.

          `items-start` so each pane scrolls with the page and the sticky
          columns inside them can pin.

          No max-width, and that is the whole of it: the editor fills the page
          column at every size. It used to stop at 110rem, which on anything
          wider than about a 1600px window left the working surface stranded in
          the middle of the screen with empty page either side of it — you had
          made the window bigger and the editor had not got bigger. The reading
          argument for a width cap (PageBody's `reading`, 48rem) is about lines
          of prose someone reads straight through; it is not about a form, which
          is what this is. */}

            column wider than the page instead of wrapping.

            flex-1 and nothing else. The document takes whatever the outline
            leaves, which is the only description of this column that stays true
            as the window and the sidebar change. It has been through two
            narrower ideas, and both showed up as empty page:

              - `reading` (48rem), inherited from the rest of the app. A section
                card is not prose — it is a form, with a header row of controls,
                a drag handle, a move-up and a move-down, an image beside its
                caption, a question beside its answer — and every one of those
                wrapped to a second line inside 48rem while the page had a spare
                600px either side of it.
              - `max-w-6xl` with `mx-auto` (72rem, centred). Better, and still a
                fixed number: past ~90rem of page column the document stopped
                growing and started drifting away from the outline instead,
                opening a gap on its left and a margin on its right that got
                wider the bigger you made the window.

            Prose inside preview is LessonView's business to set — this column
            is a bound, not a measure. */}
