// Real-time lesson collaboration over a Cloudflare Durable Object (one WebSocket
// per participant). This replaces the previous PeerJS/WebRTC peer-to-peer relay:
// instead of the host relaying between browsers, every participant connects a
// single WebSocket to a server-side "room" (the CollabRoom Durable Object; see
// apps/api/src/collab-room.js). The Worker verifies the signed-in user's Supabase
// JWT before the connection reaches the room, so only logged-in users can join
// and their identity is established server-side rather than self-asserted.
//
// Admission model — unchanged from the user's point of view. A guest who connects
// is NOT a collaborator yet: they wait until the host adds them (see `admit`).
// Only after being added does the room hand them the lesson and start syncing.
// Trusted collaborators (an email list saved on the doc) bypass the waiting room:
// the host auto-admits them the instant their request arrives.
//
// Sync model — a CRDT (Yjs). Each participant keeps a Y.Doc mirroring the editor's
// plain document; the room merges and relays the updates. Two people editing
// different blocks both keep their work, where the previous whole-document
// last-write-wins model silently dropped one of them. lib/ydoc.js owns the
// document model and the plain-JSON <-> Yjs bridge; this file owns the socket.
//
// The loop, and why it settles:
//
//   local edit  -> setDoc -> reconcile(ydoc, doc, LOCAL) -> Yjs emits an update
//                                                        -> we send it
//   remote frame -> Y.applyUpdate(..., REMOTE) -> onRemoteDoc(docFromY(ydoc))
//                -> setDoc -> reconcile again -> no difference -> no update
//
// That last step is the whole trick: `reconcile` is idempotent, so applying a
// remote edit doesn't bounce it straight back. It replaces the old approach of
// stringifying the document and comparing it against the last one we sent.
//
// Wire protocol — binary frames for speed, defined once in
// packages/core/src/collabFrames.js (see it for the frame shapes). This file owns
// the socket and the React state around it. A peer is identified by a
// server-assigned numeric "slot"; we map slot -> identity from the presence
// roster so cursors and chat can be labelled without shipping a name in every
// packet.
