// The editor's version-control controller: keeps a lesson's repository in step
// with the document being edited, and commits periodically.
//
// Why periodically, rather than per edit? A commit per keystroke would be
// unreadable as history and would churn IndexedDB. So edits accumulate in the
// document, and a commit is taken when the user *pauses* (IDLE_MS) — or, if they
// never pause, at least every MAX_WAIT_MS, so a long uninterrupted stretch of
// typing still gets checkpointed. A commit whose tree matches HEAD is skipped
// outright (see repo.js commitDoc), so an idle editor never accretes empty
// commits.
//
// The repository is set up lazily on mount:
//   - a lesson that already has a local repo just opens it
//   - a hub lesson with no local repo clones its published history (so opening
//     the same lesson on another machine brings its whole timeline with it)
//   - anything else gets a fresh repo, seeded with a root commit of the current
//     doc, so there is always a baseline to diff against
//
// Which repository that is comes from the lesson being edited: its hub id once
// it has one, and otherwise its id in this device's library. Switching lessons
// in the editor therefore changes `repoId`, which re-runs the setup effect and
// opens the other lesson's history — nothing here has to be told about it.
