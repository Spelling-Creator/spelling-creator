// The git engine, behind one dynamic import.
//
// isomorphic-git and LightningFS are ~200 KB that only the editor ever needs —
// nobody reading the homepage or browsing the hub should download a git
// implementation. Everything that touches the object store is re-exported from
// here, and loaded on demand via load.js when the editor mounts.
//
// The pure parts of the version-control layer are NOT here: the document diff
// (ops.js), the merge (merge.js) and the doc helpers (doc.js) have no git
// dependency, so the history and merge dialogs can import them directly and
// still render without the engine present.

// isomorphic-git writes git objects through Node's `Buffer`, which browsers
// don't have — without this, the first writeBlob dies with "Buffer is not
// defined".
//
// Deliberately done here rather than with rspack's ProvidePlugin: ProvidePlugin
// injects the polyfill into *every* module that so much as mentions `Buffer`,
// which in this app means docx, mammoth and html2pdf as well — pulling the
// polyfill into the main bundle and, worse, potentially flipping those libraries
// onto their Node code paths. Setting the global inside this chunk keeps the
// polyfill where it's needed and leaves every other module exactly as it was.
