//
// This is a second Vite entry (`vite build --ssr`, see vite.config.js) built for
// the workerd runtime, and it is deliberately *not* src/main.jsx. main.jsx does
// several things that only make sense in a browser and would throw here — it
// appends font <link>s to document.head, imports the stylesheet, registers a
// service worker and mounts a toaster. What the two share is the part that
// matters: the same components, the same providers, and the same
// @spelling-creator/core modules the browser calls.
//
// The Worker calls render() with data it has already fetched (see
// apps/api/src/routes/ssr.js) and streams the result into the built index.html.
// Nothing here fetches: the Worker owns the data so it can decide the response
// status before a single byte of HTML is committed.

// resolves to, so the hydrated text matches.
// `init()` returns a promise, but it is not awaited and does not need to be:
// every namespace is compiled into the bundle (see lib/i18n.js), and with inline
// resources and no backend i18next initialises synchronously — `isInitialized`
// is already true when this returns. `initImmediate: false` pins that down, so
