// App shell — defines the client-side routes.
//
// Every page of the app renders inside one layout route, `AppShell`, which is
// what makes the chrome identical everywhere: the same sidebar, at the same
// width, collapsing the same way and remembering the same state, on the
// homepage and the editor and everything between. Pages describe only their own
// body, and use PageBody for its column so the columns line up too.
//
// There is exactly one exception, and it is deliberate rather than left over:
//
//   /oauth/authorize  — the MCP consent screen, reached by redirect from a
//                       third-party client (apps/api/src/routes/oauth.js). App
//                       navigation on a grant screen is an invitation to wander
//                       off in the middle of one, so it renders bare.
//
// Which routes are lazy is a deliberate split, not a blanket policy:
//
//   Eager — "/", "/hub", "/users/:id" and "/hub/:id" with all its tabs but
//   History. The lesson, hub and profile routes are server-rendered
//   (apps/api/src/routes/ssr.js), so their components have to be in the bundle
//   the client hydrates with; deferring them would trade a smaller download for
//   a hydration round-trip on exactly the pages where first paint matters most.
//   "/" is the landing page — the most common entry point, and not worth a
//   chunk request.
//
//   Lazy — "/hub/:id/history", "/editor", "/moderation", "/login" and
//   "/oauth/authorize". None is server-rendered and none is reachable without a
//   deliberate click. History is the only reader-facing page that needs
//   isomorphic-git and LightningFS (~200 KB). The editor is the one that really
//   matters: ~6,000 lines and the only owner of Yjs, lib0 and the collaboration
//   client, none of which anyone reading a lesson should be downloading —
//   EditorShell exists to hold that chunk boundary.
//
// Tiptap/ProseMirror stays in the eager graph on purpose — CommentsSection uses
// RichTextInput on the public lesson page, so it is not editor-only.

// has a boundary of its own, so a lazy page inside the shell keeps the sidebar
// and the page bar on screen and only its body is replaced.
