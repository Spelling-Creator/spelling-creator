 * and fails the entire build anywhere else — inside a container without git
 * installed, or in a build from a source tarball that has no `.git` at all. Both
 * are ordinary ways to build this (see the Dockerfile), and a missing timestamp
 * is not worth failing over.
 *
 * Detected rather than configured, so it needs no flag to be passed and cannot
 * be got wrong. Checks for a repository too, not just the binary: git being
 * installed says nothing about whether there is any history to read.
