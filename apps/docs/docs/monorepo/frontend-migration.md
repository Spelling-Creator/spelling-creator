# Frontend migration

A decision record. **Resolved: option D (stay on React, add SSR).** The rest of
this page is kept as the reasoning, because the measurement that settled it is
worth not repeating.

## The decision

Option C (Solid without a meta-framework) was measured against option D and lost
on its own terms. The short version:

- The reactivity win lands on **~2% of the shipped bytes**. Before any of this
  work, initial JS was **981 kB gzipped**; React itself was ~15-20 kB of it. The
  ~800 kB `vendor` chunk was the actual problem, and it was full of `docx`,
  `mammoth`, `html2pdf.js` and `html2canvas`: an export pipeline nobody needs
  until they click Export.
- Conversion cost is 14,600 lines plus a silent-failure mode (destructured
  props) across 107 sites.
- The one place fine-grained reactivity would genuinely pay (the editor's
  per-field and presence rendering) is phase 5, gated on `solid-tiptap`, which
  was last published in August 2025. That is the same exposure as option B, so
  C's "Medium" ecosystem risk in the table below was too generous.

What was done instead, in order:

| Change                                                                           | Effect                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Export pipeline behind a dynamic import; editor and other non-public routes lazy | initial JS **981 kB down to 406 kB gzipped**          |
| React 18.3 to 19                                                                 | document metadata hoisting; compiler targets 19       |
| Hand-rolled SSR on the Worker for `/hub`, `/hub/:id`, `/users/:id`               | real HTML for readers and crawlers, no meta-framework |

See [Server rendering](../web-app/server-rendering.md) and
[How the export pipeline works](../web-app/export-pipeline.md) for what shipped.

Solid remains available later, if the editor's reactivity cost ever becomes the
_measured_ problem rather than the assumed one.

### What the bundle actually contained

Attributed through sourcemaps, before the split:

| Chunk         | gzipped | Dominated by                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `vendor`      | 802 kB  | html2pdf.js, docx, html2canvas, yjs, prosemirror-view, mammoth, jszip          |
| `index` (app) | 119 kB  | all 14,600 lines of view layer                                                 |
| `react`       | 59 kB   | of which react-router is the larger share; react + react-dom is ~143 kB of src |

All three were `modulepreload`ed, so all three were on the critical path for
`/hub/:id`. The framework was never the weight.

Everything below is the original record, kept as written. Later corrections are
marked as block quotes rather than edited in, so the reasoning at the time stays
legible.

## What phase 1 established

Eighteen modules read `import.meta.env` at module scope: bundler-specific, and
absent in Node, in the Worker, and under any other bundler. They now read through
`@spelling-creator/core/config`, and `apps/web/src/main.jsx` is the only place in
the app that touches `import.meta.env`.

Reads resolve **lazily**. ES imports are hoisted, so `configureCore` runs after
every module in the graph has been evaluated; anything capturing a value at import
time would capture `""`. Six exported flags (`supabaseEnabled`,
`googleDriveEnabled`, `lessonHubEnabled`, `notificationsEnabled`,
`profilesEnabled`, `gitRemoteEnabled`) were exactly that mistake waiting to
happen, and are now `hasSupabase()`, `hasGoogleDrive()` and `hasApi()`.

The result:

| Area                          | Lines               | Fate under any migration |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `packages/core`               | ~7,500 (+635 tests) | Ports untouched          |
| `apps/web/src/lib`            | ~1,900              | React hooks and contexts |
| `apps/web` pages + components | ~13,000             | Rewritten                |

So the surface is roughly **14,600 lines of view layer**, against ~8,100 lines of
lesson logic that already runs in the browser, in Node and inside the Worker.

**This is the part that was worth doing regardless.** It also surfaced three
drifted copy-paste duplications (`wikimedia`, `richText`, the Atom feed parser),
a lockfile that had never installed what its manifest claimed, and a repository
running zero tests in CI.

## The "one package" question

A common expectation is that a meta-framework unifies client and server into one
package. That unification already happened here, and it is `packages/core`: the
same modules the browser calls are callable from a server render.

Whatever is chosen should **not** absorb `apps/api`. It owns the `CollabRoom`
Durable Object, hosts the MCP server behind its own OAuth provider, and holds the
R2, KV, Workers AI and Browser Rendering bindings. Folding those into a web
framework would mean every UI deploy redeploys the collaboration runtime.

## The SSR question (independent of framework)

| Route                                                  | Primary data                           | SSR                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `/hub/:id`                                             | `fetchLesson(id)`, public JSON         | Yes, fully             |
| `/hub`                                                 | `fetchPublishedLessons()`, public JSON | Yes; drafts hydrate    |
| `/users/:id`                                           | `fetchUserProfile(id)`, public JSON    | Yes; activity hydrates |
| `/`                                                    | all fetches auth-gated or DOMParser    | Shell only             |
| `/editor`, `/login`, `/oauth/authorize`, `/moderation` | IndexedDB, Yjs, auth                   | No                     |

Every route worth server-rendering is a **public read**. The server renders
anonymously and the personalised parts hydrate on the client, so the Supabase
session (`localStorage`, PKCE, invisible to a server) never needs migrating to
cookies. That is what keeps SSR tractable here.

`fetchLatestLessons` and `fetchUserActivity` cannot be server-rendered at all:
they parse Atom with `DOMParser` and live in
`@spelling-creator/core/browser/feeds`. Both are dashboard/menu content, so
hydrating them is correct.

### What SSR replaces, and what it doesn't

`apps/api/src/routes/render.js` uses Browser Rendering for **two** unrelated jobs:

- **`prerender()`**: a headless-Chromium HTML snapshot for ~30 crawler
  user-agents. SSR genuinely replaces this, along with `shouldPrerender()`, the
  `CRAWLER_UA` regex, and `apps/web/src/lib/seo.js` (226 lines across 7 pages).
- **`ogImage()`**: live 1200x630 screenshots for link previews. **SSR does not
  replace this.** Deleting it is a feature loss.

The intended replacement is [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori), which
generates an SVG that `@resvg/resvg-wasm` rasterises to PNG. Both are pure
JS/WASM and run in a Worker, so the `browser` binding, `@cloudflare/puppeteer`
and the `nodejs_compat` flag can all go. Two consequences to accept
deliberately: Satori cannot use system fonts, so Fraunces and Public Sans must be
embedded as assets; and previews become a **designed card** rather than a
screenshot. Probably an improvement for a lesson, but a visual change.

> What shipped is narrower than this. `useDocumentMeta` and its 226 lines are
> gone, replaced by React 19's hoisted metadata. But `prerender()`,
> `shouldPrerender()` and `CRAWLER_UA` **stay**: they still cover `/`, whose
> content is auth-gated, and they are the fallback when an SSR attempt fails.
> Satori was not attempted, so `ogImage()`, the `browser` binding and
> `nodejs_compat` are all untouched. Both remain open follow-ups.

## Options considered

### A: SvelteKit

Mature meta-framework, `adapter-cloudflare` targets Workers-with-assets directly.
Costs: the whole view layer is rewritten into a different template language, and
`.svelte` files are not meaningfully supported by oxfmt/oxlint, likely
reintroducing `prettier-plugin-svelte` and `eslint-plugin-svelte`, partially
undoing the oxc migration.

### B: Solid + SolidStart

Keeps JSX, but SolidStart is the weak link: **104K weekly downloads against
SvelteKit's 2.5M**, on precisely the layer being adopted. Kobalte, the component
foundation, is still 0.13.x.

> Re-checked when the decision was made: Solid's own ecosystem is healthier than
> this reads: `solid-js` 3.4M/wk, `@solidjs/router` since released as 1.0.0,
> Kobalte 338K/wk and actively maintained (though still 0.13.x). The 104K figure
> is SolidStart specifically and still accurate. The binding that actually
> matters for this app is `solid-tiptap`, last published August 2025.

### C: Solid without a meta-framework

Keeps JSX and the current SPA-served-by-the-Worker architecture. No SSR, so the
prerender stays, though `solid-js/web` exports `renderToStringAsync`, and
hand-rolling SSR for four read-only routes in the existing Worker is bounded work
that can come later.

### D: Stay on React, add SSR

The cheapest route to the only clear architectural win. React 19 SSR on the
Worker already running. Forgoes the reactivity improvement entirely.

> As originally written this said "React 19", but the app was on **18.3.1**,
> so D also meant an upgrade. It turned out to be a bump and one config line:
> every React-coupled dependency (`radix-ui`, `@tiptap/react`, `react-i18next`,
> `sonner`, `react-router-dom`, `@tsparticles/react`, `lucide-react`) already
> declared a `^19` peer, and there were no `defaultProps`, `propTypes`,
> `ReactDOM.render` or `findDOMNode` call sites. React 19 also earns its keep
> here beyond SSR: it hoists `<title>`/`<meta>` from anywhere in the tree, which
> deleted `useDocumentMeta` (226 lines across 7 pages) outright.

### Comparison

|                  | View-layer cost | SSR                   | Toolchain      | Ecosystem risk |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| A SvelteKit      | Full rewrite    | Excellent             | oxc regression | Low            |
| B SolidStart     | Conversion      | Unproven here         | oxc kept       | High           |
| C Solid, no meta | Conversion      | None (later, by hand) | oxc kept       | Medium         |
| D React + SSR    | None            | Hand-rolled           | Unchanged      | None           |

## What the spikes showed

### SvelteKit

A throwaway app on Svelte 5.56.8 / Kit 2.70.2 / adapter-cloudflare 7.2.9, with
one route whose `+page.server.js` imported `@spelling-creator/core/users`
directly. Against a stub API the server response carried the profile name,
follower count, lesson list and the `<svelte:head>` title and `og:title`, with no
JavaScript executed, exactly what the prerender produces today.

Two things it confirmed beyond the happy path: `fetchUserProfile` is **the same
module the React app calls from the browser**, with no server-specific client;
and **no browser-tier module leaked into the server bundle**, so the
`core/browser/*` split holds under a real SSR build and not only under the lint
rule.

### Solid: a negative result worth recording

`@rsbuild/plugin-solid` 1.2.2 **did not transform JSX** under
`@rsbuild/core` 2.1.10, in either a shared config or a dedicated one. Output was
React's JSX runtime in both cases (`React.createElement`, plus React Compiler
memoisation artifacts in the shared config), and `rsbuild inspect` showed **no
babel loader in the resolved Rspack config**; the plugin is silently a no-op.
Scoping `pluginReact` with `exclude` did not hand the file over. Peer ranges are
compatible, so this looks like a v1-era plugin against the v2 plugin API rather
than a hard incompatibility, but it was not resolved.

`vite` 8.2.0 with `vite-plugin-solid` 2.11.14 compiled the identical source
correctly: Solid's `template`/`insert` output with getter-based props.

**Consequence, since acted on:** a Solid app needs Vite today, not Rsbuild, so
`apps/web` was moved to Vite 8 on its own, still on React, before any framework
decision. See [Build tooling](#build-tooling) below. That removes the "second
build tool" cost from options B and C: a Solid app would now be a second entry
under the same bundler, and `.jsx` stays `.jsx`, so oxfmt/oxlint are preserved
either way.

## Build tooling

`apps/web` runs on **Vite 8** (`apps/web/vite.config.js`). This was done on its
own, still on React, so that changing the build tool and changing the framework
are separately attributable, the control group the risk list below asks for.

Why, beyond unblocking B and C: Vite 8 bundles with **Rolldown**, which uses
**Oxc** for JavaScript parsing, transforms and minification, and minifies CSS
with **Lightning CSS**, a separate Parcel project, not part of Oxc. So the
bundler's JavaScript pipeline now runs on the same engine as `oxlint` and
`oxfmt`, and `apps/web`'s Vitest runs on that same Vite 8. Before this, building
went through Rspack/SWC while linting and formatting went through Oxc, and
`node_modules` carried both toolchains.

What the move cost, measured against the Rsbuild build it replaced:

|                   | Rsbuild  | Vite 8   |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- |
| JS, gzipped total | 1,048 kB | 1,044 kB |
| App chunk         | 401 kB   | 400 kB   |
| Lazy git engine   | 186 kB   | 197 kB   |
| Build time        | n/a      | ~2s      |

Notes on the config, all of which are load-bearing:

- **`VITE_*` env vars need no config**: Vite substitutes `import.meta.env`
  natively, so Rsbuild's `loadEnv`/`publicVars` shim is gone. The prefix that
  had been kept for continuity is now simply correct.
- **The React Compiler runs natively in Oxc** (`react({ compiler: true })`,
  backed by the optional `oxc-transform-react` peer), not as a Babel pass and
  not through SWC. It is the React team's Rust port of the compiler, run on
  Oxc's AST before the JSX transform, so `@babel/core`, `@rolldown/plugin-babel`
  and `babel-plugin-react-compiler` are gone. Its default target is React 19,
  which imports the memoisation hooks from `react/compiler-runtime` that React
  itself exports. `oxc-transform-react` is pinned with `~` because
  `@vitejs/plugin-react` declares it as a `^0.x` peer, which only accepts one
  minor version; bump the two together.
  - **Why it was switched:** the Babel pass was about 2s of a 3.4s production
    build; with Oxc the build takes about 1.35s, the same as building with no
    compiler at all. SWC also ships the Rust port, but on Vite 8
    `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` turns Oxc off and runs SWC on every file, so it
    would have swapped one extra toolchain for another.
  - **How it was checked:** every module's transformed output was captured from
    client and SSR builds under Babel compiler 1.0.0, under the last TypeScript
    compiler build (`0.0.0-experimental-a1856f3-20260507`), and under Oxc. Where
    both compile a function, Oxc's output differs from the TypeScript build only
    in names, comment placement and helper order. The changes against 1.0.0 are
    the compiler's own improvements since that release (for example memoising
    `t(...)` calls and treating `useState` setters as stable). Oxc also compiles
    files 1.0.0 gave up on (`try`/`catch` blocks containing `?.`, `&&` or
    ternaries, and an internal error in `CollabCursors`), and, like 1.0.0, still
    skips any function that suppresses `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`.
- **`codeSplitting.groups` is not optional.** Rolldown puts everything reachable
  from the entry in one chunk, where Rsbuild split vendors by default; without
  the groups, editing one app file invalidates ~3.4 MB for returning visitors.
  Both groups are tagged `$initial` so they capture only the statically-reachable
  graph; untagged, the vendor group also swallows isomorphic-git and the
  tsparticles shapes, which are supposed to stay behind a dynamic import.
- **No `build.target` override.** Vite 8's `baseline-widely-available` default
  (chrome111, edge111, firefox114, safari16.4) governs **JavaScript syntax
  only**. It is wider than the `["defaults", "not IE 11"]` browserslist this app
  used to compile against, which now resolves to a floor of chrome 109,
  edge 146, firefox 140, safari 26.3, so chrome 109-110 is the only JS coverage
  given up.
- **The effective floor is CSS, not JS.** Tailwind v4 supports **Chrome 111,
  Safari 16.4 and Firefox 128**, and this build emits what that implies:
  `@property` (70 occurrences) and `color-mix()` (92) in `index-*.css`. Firefox
  114-127 satisfies Vite's JS target but **cannot render this stylesheet**;
  `@property` did not ship in Firefox until 128. The app's real support window
  is therefore chrome111 / safari16.4 / **firefox128**, and lowering
  `build.target` would not widen it.

**Vitest versions are deliberately split.** `apps/web` is on Vitest 4, because
Vitest 3 depends on `vite ^5 || ^6 || ^7` and would otherwise run tests through
a second, older Vite major than the one that builds the app, silently, since
`apps/web` currently has no tests. `packages/core` and `apps/api` stay on
Vitest 3: `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` declares a `vitest 2.0.x - 3.2.x`
peer, so a repo-wide bump breaks the Worker suite. Raise `apps/api` only when
the pool package widens that range.

**`apps/docs` moved to VitePress**, which is what finally took Rspack out of the
tree: it was the last Rspress-shaped thing left. The pages themselves needed
almost nothing: they were already plain Markdown with relative `.md` links, so
the migration was a config rewrite plus dropping the `sidebar_position`
frontmatter that a hand-maintained sidebar had already superseded. Two features
that were bespoke config before are now off-the-shelf: `llms.txt` comes from
[`vitepress-plugin-llms`](https://github.com/okineadev/vitepress-plugin-llms),
and the docs sitemap from VitePress's built-in `sitemap` option.

**It runs the 2.0 alpha deliberately, not the `latest` tag.** `vitepress@latest`
still resolves to 1.6.4, published August 2025; there has been no 1.x release
since, because development moved wholesale to the 2.0 line, which ships regularly
(alpha.19 is from August 2026). Taking `latest` here would mean installing the
_older_ of the two live options.

The version that settles it is Vite's. VitePress 1.6 pins **Vite 5**, so it would
have added a second Vite major to a repo that builds `apps/web` on **Vite 8**;
VitePress 2 depends on Vite `^8.2.0` and **deduplicates onto the same install**.
The docs site therefore adds no bundler and no extra Vite major: the goal the
Rsbuild-to-Vite move above was chasing, finished. (`vite@7` is still in the tree,
but from `agents` and the Vitest 3 that `apps/api` and `packages/core` pin,
nothing to do with the docs.)

The alpha risk is bounded by what this app is: a static site rendered at build
time, in CI, before anything deploys. A regression is a failed build on a pull
request, not a broken page for a reader. That is why the range is a caret:
`^2.0.0-alpha.19`, which admits later alphas and 2.x stable alike, with the
lockfile holding the version that actually builds (`2.0.0-alpha.19` today). A
refresh that moves it forward gets caught by the same CI build.

### Vite+: evaluated, deferred

Vite+ (`vite-plus`, MIT, beta) bundles Vite, Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt, Rolldown and
a caching monorepo task runner behind one `vp` CLI. It was considered at the same
time and deferred, for reasons that are about sequencing rather than merit:

- It ships its own `oxlint` and `oxfmt` binaries, which are **LSP-only wrappers
  that exit 1** when invoked as linters. They lose the `.bin` slot to this repo's
  direct `oxlint`/`oxfmt` devDependencies, so installing it alongside them is
  harmless, but adopting it means removing those, and `pnpm lint` is
  `oxfmt --check . && oxlint`.
- Its docs explicitly do not recommend `.oxlintrc.json` or `.oxfmtrc.json`;
  config belongs in `lint`/`fmt` blocks in `vite.config.ts`. This repo's
  `.oxlintrc.json` is 95 lines of per-package overrides, including the one
  enforcing the `core/browser/*` boundary, and override semantics differ.
- `vp migrate` aliases `vite` to Vite+ core through a workspace-root pnpm
  override and removes `vitest` as a direct dependency. `apps/api` runs
  `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`, which peers on a specific Vitest.
- 0.2.8 pins `oxlint =1.76.0` and `oxfmt =0.61.0`; this repo is ahead of both.

Its own prerequisite is Vite 8 + Vitest 4.1, which this move satisfies. Revisit
at 1.0, on a branch, by running `vp migrate --no-interactive` and reading the
diff.

## If option C is chosen: the plan

Conversion surface, measured:

| Site                                    | Count |
| --------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `.jsx` files (37 app + 22 shadcn `ui/`) | 59    |
| `useState` to `createSignal`            | 189   |
| `.map()` to `<For>`                     | 70    |
| Destructured props to `props.x`         | 107   |
| `useEffect` to `createEffect`/`onMount` | 51    |
| `useMemo`/`useCallback`                 | 40    |
| `useRef`                                | 26    |
| react-router call sites                 | 44    |

No `createPortal`, no `cloneElement`, only 6 context sites. The 58 `forwardRef`
wrappers all live in `ui/` and **disappear**: in Solid `ref` is an ordinary prop.

1. **Foundation** (~2,000 lines). Vite + `vite-plugin-solid`, `@solidjs/router`,
   port `ui/` onto Kobalte, plus the three contexts. Nothing user-visible ships.
   This is the gate: Kobalte is 0.13.x and everything sits on it. Check `field`,
   `spinner` and `star-rating` first.
2. **Leaf components** (~1,200). `LessonView`, `RichText`, `RichTextInput`,
   `LiveField`, `Skeletons`, `AppHeader`, `NavActions`.
3. **Read-only routes** (~2,300). `ProfilePage`, `HubPage`, `LessonPage`,
   `CommentsSection`, `LessonSummary`, the SSR-worthy set.
4. **The rest** (~1,900). `ModerationPage`, `HomePage`, `OAuthAuthorizePage`,
   `LoginPage`, and the remaining dialogs.
5. **The editor** (~6,000), its own project. `EditorPage`, `SectionCard`,
   `ContentBlock`, the collab dialogs, plus `collab.js` and `useLessonGit`.

Two design calls to make before phase 5 rather than during:

- **Keep the lesson document in a plain signal with whole-value replacement.**
  Version history recovers intent by diffing successive whole documents
  (`diffDocs` in `git/ops.js`). A fine-grained `createStore` is the idiomatic
  Solid move and would quietly complicate that.
- **Spend fine-grained reactivity on fields, not the document**: `LiveField`,
  presence, cursors, per-block rendering. That is where React costs the most
  today.

### The failure mode to build a habit around

Destructuring a prop in Solid does not error. It silently stops updating. There
is no warning and no crash, only a component that mysteriously fails to react.
With 107 sites to convert, treat "no destructured props" as a review rule from
day one, not a cleanup task.

## Risks common to A, B and C

- **Two bundles during coexistence.** Both runtimes ship until the last route
  moves.
- **No control group.** Changing design and framework together makes a regression
  un-attributable. Keep the React build deployable and per-route switchable
  longer than feels necessary.
- **The editor may have no clean seam.** Everything above it is a route portable
  in isolation; `/editor` is one large component entangled with collab and git.
  If it stalls, coexistence lasts a long time.
- **Agent tooling is React-shaped.** The `shadcn` skill, `AGENTS.md` and ~25 docs
  pages all assume shadcn-React.
