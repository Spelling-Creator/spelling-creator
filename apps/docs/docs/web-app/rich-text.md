# Rich text (comments & bios)

The two things users write about each other, **lesson comments** and **profile
bios**, are rich text. Both are authored with a small [tiptap](https://tiptap.dev)
editor (`RichTextInput.jsx`, built directly on `@tiptap/react` with a shadcn
`ToggleGroup` toolbar) and stored as **sanitized HTML**.

Users can format text and link out. They **cannot embed media**: no images, video,
audio or frames, whether uploaded, dragged in, pasted, or hand-written into a
request. That is a deliberate product rule, and most of this page is about where it
is actually enforced.

## What a user can write

| Available                                             | Not available                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, inline `code` | Images, video, audio, `<iframe>`, `<svg>`       |
| Bulleted and numbered lists, blockquotes              | Headings, horizontal rules, code blocks, tables |
| Links (http/https/mailto)                             | Any attribute other than a validated `href`     |

Headings and tables are left out on purpose: a comment is a paragraph, not a
document.

## The pieces

| File                                              | Role                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@spelling-creator/core/richText`                 | **The policy.** Allow-list, link schemes, link `rel`/`target`, HTML to text. |
| `packages/core/src/richText.test.js`              | Its tests: link safety, the allow-list, the browser-side helpers.            |
| `apps/api/src/lib/richtext.js`                    | **The boundary.** Sanitizes on write (parse5).                               |
| `apps/api/src/lib/richtext.test.js`               | Its tests: media, XSS, links, legacy values.                                 |
| `apps/web/src/components/RichTextInput.jsx`       | The editor (toolbar, limits, no media affordances).                          |
| `apps/web/src/components/RichText.jsx`            | The renderer, for both rich text and legacy plain text.                      |
| `@spelling-creator/core/browser/sanitizeRichText` | Render-time sanitizing (DOMPurify).                                          |

The two sanitizers are deliberately separate, but not for the reason they
originally were. The write-side one used to be built on HTMLRewriter, which only
exists in the Workers runtime; it parses with parse5 now and would run anywhere.
What keeps them apart is what they are _for_: the write-side pass decides what
may be stored, and the render-side DOMPurify pass is defence in depth against
rows written by an older server. What they **agree** on is shared: which tags survive,
which link schemes are real links, what a surviving link is rewritten to carry,
and how markup flattens to text. Those used to be two hand-maintained copies
under different names (`richTextToPlain` on the Worker, `richTextToPlainText` in
the browser), each with a comment asking the reader to keep them in sync.

## Where "no media" is actually enforced

The editor has no image button, but a toolbar is a suggestion, not a boundary.
Anyone can `POST` hand-written HTML straight at the Worker, so the rule is enforced
in four places, only the third of which is load-bearing:

1. **No media button** in the toolbar, so nothing offers it.
2. **No image/media node in the tiptap schema**, so a pasted `<img>` has nowhere to
   go and is dropped on the way in; `handlePaste`/`handleDrop` additionally refuse
   dropped and pasted _files_, which is what stops the browser from helpfully
   inlining a dragged-in screenshot as a giant `data:` URI.
3. **The Worker's sanitizer** (`sanitizeRichText`), the only one of these a hostile
   client cannot skip. It is an **allow-list**: anything not explicitly permitted is
   dropped, so a tag nobody thought of fails closed. Media tags are removed along
   with their content, and every attribute is stripped except a validated `href`.
4. **A second sanitizing pass at render time** (DOMPurify, in `@spelling-creator/core/browser/sanitizeRichText`).
   The render path uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and a reader's safety shouldn't
   depend on assuming every row in the database was written by the current server
   code. Rows predating rich text, or written by some future path that forgets to
   sanitize, are caught here.

The sanitizer is built on [parse5](https://github.com/inikulin/parse5), a
WHATWG-conformant HTML parser. Using a real parser is the non-negotiable part: it
sees the same tag soup a browser would, where a regex-based "sanitizer" is the
classic way to ship an XSS hole (`<img/src=x onerror=…>`, `<scr<script>ipt>`).

It was HTMLRewriter, the Workers runtime's own streaming parser, until
self-hosting made that a problem: HTMLRewriter runs in one runtime, so any other
host would have needed a second sanitizer, and two implementations of a security
boundary that have to agree is a worse thing to own than a dependency, because
the drift would be silent and it would be an XSS hole.

Swapping a streaming parser for a tree-building one brought one new concern with
it. The routes cap raw input at 20,000 characters and `<b>` is three of them, so
a caller can send a tree nearly 7,000 levels deep, enough to exhaust the stack
in any tree-shaped walk. The walk is iterative, and nesting past 100 levels is
flattened to its text, the same thing that happens to unrecognised markup
everywhere else. The editor's deepest possible output is five.

It brought one other, sharper concern. An unknown tag is normally _unwrapped_
(the tag goes and its words stay), but that is only safe for tags whose content
was parsed as markup. HTML's raw-text elements (`script`, `style`, `xmp`,
`iframe`, `noembed`, `noframes`, `plaintext`, `noscript`) hold literal text, and
a serializer writes their content back **unescaped** because that is what a
browser expects to find inside them. Unwrapping one would therefore turn its
`<script>alert(1)</script>` body from words into markup on the way out. All of
them are dropped with their content instead, and anything that survives the walk
is re-parented onto the node it is actually written under, so escaping is never
decided by an element that was removed.

### Links

Links are the one thing a user may embed. Only `http:`, `https:` and `mailto:`
targets survive (`javascript:` executes, and `data:` is an HTML/media smuggling
channel), and the check is run against the URL with control characters stripped, so
`java\tscript:` doesn't sneak past it. Every surviving link is rewritten to carry
`target="_blank"` and `rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer"`: user-generated links
open away from the app, earn spammers no SEO value, and can't reach back through
`window.opener`. A link whose target fails the check keeps its words and loses the
link.

The editor applies the same rule up front (tiptap's `isAllowedUri` hook runs
`isSafeLinkCandidate` from the shared policy), so a user is never shown a link,
typed or autolinked, that the server would only strip on save. The "candidate"
variant exists because autolink validates the matched text before a scheme is
attached: `example.com` is judged as the `http://example.com` it will be stored
as, while anything that already names a scheme is judged as-is. As everywhere
else, this is the honest-user half; the Worker's check is the boundary.

## Text, not markup

Everything downstream of storage wants text, not markup, and gets it from
`richTextToPlain` in `@spelling-creator/core/richText`:

- **The profanity filter** scans words, not tag names and URLs.
- **Length limits** (2000 characters for a comment, 500 for a bio) count what the
  user _wrote_, so wrapping a sentence in `<strong>` never costs them their budget.
  The editor's live counter calls the same function the server's limit does, so the
  number a user sees is the number the server enforces. This used to be two mirrored
  implementations that had to be changed together; it is now one.
- **The Atom feed's `<summary>`**, **notification bodies**, the **profile meta/OG
  description**, and the **one-line bio** in the followers list are all plain-text
  contexts. Markup rendered into them would appear as literal escaped tags in feed
  readers, search snippets and link previews.

A comment or bio consisting of nothing but media sanitizes down to nothing, and is
rejected (or, for a bio, stored as empty) rather than saved as blank markup.

## Editing

An author may **edit their own comment** after posting
(`PATCH /lessons/:id/comments/:commentId`). Ownership is decided by comparing the
stored `author_id` against the verified JWT, never by anything the request claims.
The new body runs through the identical sanitize, length and profanity pipeline as a
fresh post, so editing is not a way to launder content past the rules that applied
when it was written.

A successful edit stamps `comments.edited_at`, which the thread renders as an
**"edited"** marker; a comment never changes silently under someone who already
read or replied to it. **Moderators cannot edit a comment**, only delete it
([Moderation](./moderation.md)): rewriting someone's words under their own name is a
power worth not having.

Bios have always been editable, and are simply saved again through
`POST /profile/bio`.

## Values written before rich text

Every comment and bio predating this feature is a bare plain-text string. They are
detected (`isRichTextHtml`) and rendered **as text**, with `white-space: pre-wrap`
so their line breaks survive, exactly as they always looked. They are never
reinterpreted as markup years after the fact. The flattening helpers pass them
through unchanged, so a plain-text value with no tags is its own plain text.
