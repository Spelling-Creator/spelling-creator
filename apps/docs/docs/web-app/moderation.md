# Moderation

On top of the automatic profanity filtering applied to comments, bios, and
display names, the hub has a **moderation** layer with two privilege tiers and a
dedicated moderation queue at `/moderation` (`ModerationPage.jsx`). The page is
gated to privileged users and is disallowed for robots.

The browser holds no authority of its own: it asks the Worker
`GET /mod/whoami` what the caller is allowed to do and renders accordingly,
and the Worker **re-derives the caller's role from the database on every
privileged request**, so a tampered client can never grant itself power.
(The Worker's moderation API lives at `/mod`, not `/moderation`; it's named
differently on purpose so it can't collide with this page's own `/moderation`
route; see the registration comment in `apps/api/src/index.js`.)

## Roles

Roles live in the `user_roles` table (`apps/api/schema.sql`). A normal signed-in
user is a plain author who can only touch their own content. Above that:

- **Moderator**: delete any comment, close any
  [proposed change](./pull-requests.md), **shadowban** a lesson, ban users by
  name, and **request** that a lesson be fully deleted.
- **Admin**: everything a moderator can do, plus: add moderators, approve a
  moderator's lesson-deletion request, fully delete a lesson, and ban users by IP.

Note what is _not_ on either list: **editing** someone else's comment. A comment can
only be edited by the person who wrote it (see [Rich text](./rich-text.md)); a
moderator's power over a bad comment is to delete it, not to rewrite it under its
author's name.

For the same reason, a moderator can **close** a proposed change but never
**merge** one. Merging writes a lesson under its author's name, which is
authorship, not moderation; only that author and the collaborators they trust can
do it.

There is deliberately **no in-app way to create an admin**; admins are seeded by
hand in the Supabase SQL editor (see the snippet at the bottom of `schema.sql`).
Admins can add moderators (`POST /mod/moderators`); `granted_by` records
which admin added each one.

## Shadowbanning vs. deletion

A **shadowbanned** lesson (`lessons.shadowbanned`) is dropped from the public hub
listing and from public single-lesson reads (it 404s to everyone except its
author and mods/admins), so the author still sees it as normal and doesn't realise
it's hidden. This is reversible and any moderator can do it.

A **full deletion** is destructive, so moderators can't do it directly: a
moderator files a row in `lesson_delete_requests` (status `pending`), and an admin
approves it (which deletes the lesson) or denies it.

## Bans

- **Name bans** (`banned_names`, created by moderators) block any account whose
  display name matches from commenting or publishing/editing. Names are stored
  normalised (lower-cased, trimmed) for an exact, case-insensitive match.
- **IP bans** (`banned_ips`, created by admins) block any request from an address.

Both are checked at the top of the content-creating Worker routes. To support
"ban this user by IP" from a piece of their content, the Worker captures the
creator's IP (`cf-connecting-ip`) into `lessons.author_ip` / `comments.author_ip`.
That column is **only ever surfaced to mods/admins**, never in public responses.

## Worker endpoints

All require a `Bearer <Supabase JWT>` and the appropriate role; the frontend
wrapper is `@spelling-creator/core/moderation`.

| `POST /mod/password`                       | admin | Set a user's password (self-hosted recovery). |

## Setting a password

An instance that signs people in with a username and has no mail server has
nowhere to send a reset link, so a forgotten password would otherwise be
unrecoverable short of the database. An admin can set one from this page,
identifying the person by username or by email, whichever they are known by.

It is **admin-only, never moderator**. Setting somebody's password is taking
their account, which is a different kind of power from hiding a lesson. An admin
may reset their own and anybody below them, but not another admin's: admins are
peers, and taking a peer's account is an escalation the tier was never meant to
allow. The section only appears at all on an instance that uses passwords;
there is nothing to set on a magic-link one.

That last rule fails closed. If the target's role cannot be read at all (the
database is unreachable, or answers with something that isn't a row list), the
reset is refused with a 502 rather than allowed through. Everywhere else an
unknown role means "no privileges" and blocks by itself; here an absent role is
what _permits_ the reset, so the same reading would hand over another admin's
account whenever the database hiccuped.

There is no audit table, so the action leaves a line in the server log naming
who reset whom. It records identities only, never the password.

Two limits worth knowing. The last admin locking themselves out is a database
problem, not an in-app one. And the reset changes the password without
necessarily ending sessions already open elsewhere, so treat it as recovery from
forgetfulness rather than as containment of a compromised account. See
