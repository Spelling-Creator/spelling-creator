# Server rendering

Three routes are rendered on the Cloudflare Worker before the browser runs any
JavaScript, and then hydrated in place:

| Route            | Data the server fetches   | Rendered for |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| `/hub`           | `fetchPublishedLessons()` | Everyone     |
| `/hub/:id`       | `fetchLesson(id)`         | Everyone     |
| `/hub/:id/<tab>` | `fetchLesson(id)`         | Everyone     |
| `/users/:id`     | `fetchUserProfile(id)`    | Everyone     |

Everything else — `/`, `/editor`, `/login`, `/oauth/authorize`, `/moderation` —
is served as the static SPA shell exactly as before.

A lesson's tabs (`/hub/:id/practice`, `/discussion`, `/proposals`,
`/proposals/:prId`, `/history` — see [Pages & routing](./pages-and-routing.md))
are all the same lesson, so one `fetchLesson` serves all of them and the tab
decides what to draw with it. `LESSON_PATH` names those five forms rather than
matching any extra segment, so it and the SPA's route table agree about what a
lesson URL is: a wildcard let `/hub/:id/anything` through, costing a lesson
fetch and a full render to produce a page that isn't one. Adding a tab means
editing both. The pattern itself lives in `apps/api/src/routes/spa.js` — the
Worker's route table, shared so that the code deciding a path is a lesson and
the code deciding it is [a page at all](./pages-and-routing.md#unknown-paths)
cannot disagree.
`LessonLayout` seeds its state from that payload and the tab reads it through
`useLesson()`, so no tab fetches the lesson a second time.

Matching the tabs is **not** optional. The service worker's `navigateFallback`
denylist excludes the whole of `/hub/*` from the precached shell (`WORKER_PATHS`
in `apps/web/vite.config.js`) precisely because the Worker answers those paths
itself. A tab that this route failed to match would be excluded from the shell
_and_ left unrendered: online it falls through to the SPA shell and still works,
offline there is nothing to fall through to and it fails outright. The two lists
have to stay in step, and both say so in a comment.

The bootstrap payload is keyed by the exact `url.pathname` the Worker rendered,
and `useServerData` only hands it to a page still on that path — so following a
tab link releases it and the layout keeps serving its own state, which is the
behaviour you want.

## Why only these three

Because their primary content is a **public read**. The Supabase session lives
in `localStorage` behind PKCE and is invisible to a server, so the render is
always anonymous; the personalised parts of the page (the account menu, an
author's Edit/Delete controls, whether you follow a profile) fill in when the
client hydrates. No session ever has to move to a cookie, which is what keeps
this tractable.

`fetchLatestLessons` and `fetchUserActivity` can't be server-rendered at all —
they parse Atom with `DOMParser`, and live in `@spelling-creator/core/browser/feeds`.
Both are dashboard content, so hydrating them is correct.

## How it fits together

```text
apps/web/src/entry-server.jsx     the app, built for workerd (`pnpm build:ssr` -> dist-ssr/)
apps/web/src/lib/ssr.jsx          the client/server handoff (SsrProvider, useServerData)
apps/api/src/routes/ssr.js        the Worker route: match, fetch, render, splice
apps/api/src/routes/spa.js        the route table, and the asset/shell/404 fall-through
```

1. `handleFrontend` (`apps/api/src/routes/render.js`) asks `shouldServerRender`.
2. `serverRender` fetches the page's data — through the very same
   `@spelling-creator/core` modules the browser calls, so the two paths can't
   drift — and calls `render()` from the server bundle.
3. `render()` returns `{ head, body }`. React hoists `<title>`/`<meta>` to the
   front of its output when rendering a subtree rather than a whole document, so
   they're split off and spliced into the real `<head>`; a scraper won't read an
   `og:` tag it finds in the body.
4. The Worker injects the body into `<div id="root">` and serialises the data
   into `window.__SSR__`.
5. `src/main.jsx` reads that, and calls `hydrateRoot` instead of `createRoot`.

**Failure is always soft.** A failed data fetch, a render error, a missing
server bundle — each falls through to the static shell, which is what the app
served before any of this existed.

One consequence is worth knowing: a lesson that genuinely does not exist takes
that same path, because a 404 from the API and a timeout reaching it arrive here
as the same thrown error. So `/hub/<deleted-id>` is still answered `200` with the
shell, and the app reports the miss after it hydrates — unlike a path that isn't
a route at all, which the Worker 404s outright
([Unknown paths](./pages-and-routing.md#unknown-paths)).

## Page metadata

`src/lib/seo.jsx` exports a `<DocumentMeta>` component, not a hook. React 19
hoists `<title>`, `<meta>` and `<link>` into `<head>` from anywhere in the tree,
so page metadata is ordinary JSX — which is exactly what makes it work under
SSR, where an effect that writes into `document.head` never runs.

JSON-LD is deliberately _not_ hoisted: React only hoists `<script>` when it's
`async`, which is meaningless for a non-executable type. `<JsonLd>` renders in
place, which search engines accept.

## Things that had to change to make it work

- **`index.html`'s site-wide social defaults are stripped** on a rendered page,
  before the page's own tags go in. Otherwise a scraper reading the _first_
  `og:title` would get the generic one.
- **The service worker must not answer these navigations.** `navigateFallback`
  would otherwise serve the precached shell and the Worker would never be asked
  — silently disabling SSR for exactly the returning visitors whose browsers
  have the shell cached. The three routes are in `WORKER_PATHS` in
  `apps/web/vite.config.js`; see [Installable app & offline use](./pwa-and-offline.md#navigation-fallback-and-the-paths-it-must-not-touch).
- **`ColorSchemeProvider` no longer reads `localStorage`/`matchMedia` during
  render.** The server can't, and a hydrating client has to render the same
  thing the server did — the theme toggle shows a sun or a moon, so this is
  markup, not just a CSS variable. The stored choice is adopted in a layout
  effect, after hydration but before paint. Page colours were already correct
  pre-paint via the inline script in `index.html`.
- **`RichText` sanitizes only in the browser.** DOMPurify needs a real DOM, so
  the rich-text branch renders nothing on the server and appears immediately
  after mount. Rendering the _unsanitized_ HTML server-side is not an
  alternative: React never re-checks `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` during
  hydration, so whatever the server wrote is what the reader keeps. A profile
  bio still reaches crawlers, as the page's meta description.
- **`src/main.jsx` and `src/entry-server.jsx` must stay structurally in step.**
  Anything that renders DOM has to appear in both, in the same order. Sonner's
  `<Toaster>` renders an empty `<section>` even with no toasts, so it's in both;
  `ServiceWorkerPrompt` renders `null` and is browser-only, so it isn't.

## What SSR replaced, and what it didn't

`apps/api/src/routes/render.js` used headless Chromium for two unrelated jobs:

- **`prerender()`** — an HTML snapshot for ~30 crawler user-agents. SSR replaces
  this for the three routes above. It's still the fallback for `/` (whose
  content is auth-gated, so an anonymous render is only ever the marketing
  splash) and for any SSR attempt that fails.
- **`ogImage()`** — live 1200×630 screenshots for link previews. **Unaffected.**
  SSR cannot take a screenshot, so the `browser` binding stays.

## Build order

The Worker imports a build artifact, so `apps/web` must be built before the
Worker is bundled:

```bash
pnpm build     # client -> apps/web/dist, server -> apps/web/dist-ssr
pnpm deploy    # runs the above, then build:docs, then wrangler deploy
```

`pnpm --filter @spelling-creator/api dev` builds the server bundle itself before
starting `wrangler dev`. The Worker test suite is unaffected: it runs against a
test-only entry (`apps/api/src/collab-room.test-worker.js`) that doesn't import
the route table.

## Local development

`pnpm dev:web` (the Vite dev server) does **not** server-render — there is no
Worker in front of it, so every route arrives as the plain SPA shell and mounts
with `createRoot`. To exercise SSR you need `pnpm dev:api`, which serves the
built assets through the real Worker.
