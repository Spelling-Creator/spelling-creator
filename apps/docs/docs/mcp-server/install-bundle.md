# Install as a one-click bundle (.mcpb), the easiest way

The server ships as an [MCPB bundle](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb): a single
`.mcpb` file Claude Desktop installs with one click: no terminal, no JSON to edit.

1. Build it (see [Packaging the bundle](./packaging.md)) or grab a prebuilt
   `spelling-creator-hub.mcpb`.
2. **Open the file with Claude Desktop.** It shows an install dialog and asks for
   your **Supabase refresh token** (stored securely in your OS keychain) and,
   optionally, the hub API URL.
3. Get a refresh token by running `pnpm --filter @spelling-creator/mcp login`
   (it prints where the session is saved; the `refresh_token` is in that file),
   or copy `refresh_token` from the web app's `sb-…-auth-token` localStorage
   entry. You also need a **display name** set on your account (do it once in the
   web app) or publishing is rejected.

That's it. The bundle carries Node.js dependencies and the manifest declares the
config, so Claude Desktop injects your token and launches the server for you.
