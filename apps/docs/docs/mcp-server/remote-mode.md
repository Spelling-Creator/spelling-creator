# Remote (hosted) mode

Point an MCP client at `https://spellingcreator.org/mcp` and it connects over
Streamable HTTP with a real OAuth 2.1 "Connect" flow: no token to copy, paste,
or store. This is the recommended way to connect a client that supports remote
MCP servers (claude.ai, Claude Desktop's remote connectors, Cursor, etc.); the
local [stdio setup](./setup.md) remains the CLI-first path.

## How it works

1. The client discovers the server's OAuth metadata and registers itself
   automatically (RFC 7591 Dynamic Client Registration), so there is nothing to
   set up on your end.
2. It opens your browser to `/authorize`, which redirects to an ordinary page
   of the web app at `/oauth/authorize`. If you're not already signed in, it
   offers the same magic-link sign-in as [`/login`](https://spellingcreator.org/login).
3. You see a consent screen showing which client is connecting and what it can
   do, and choose **Approve** or **Deny**.
4. The client receives its own access/refresh token pair and starts calling
   tools. No Supabase token is ever shown to you or passed to the client; the
   server holds your session and mints requests to the hub's normal endpoints
   on your behalf.

The tool layer (`src/tools.js`) and API client (`src/api.js`) are the exact
same code the [stdio server](./setup.md) uses: the same tools, the same
validation, the same author attribution. That includes the
[live session](./live-sessions.md) tools: `HubMcp` hibernates between tool
calls and rebuilds its server on the way back, so the one thing those tools
must remember (which session the connection is in) is kept in the Durable
Object's own storage rather than in the server. See
[Asking, not listening](./live-sessions.md#asking-not-listening).

## Worker-side implementation

The whole thing is implemented in `apps/api`, not `apps/mcp`; the MCP package
only supplies the two remote-specific pieces the Worker composes:

- **`src/worker.js`** (`@spelling-creator/mcp/worker`): `buildMcpServer`
  (build a connection-scoped `McpServer` given any auth provider),
  `grantAuth` (an auth provider seeded from an OAuth grant's `props`, with the
  same getAccessToken()/forceRefresh() shape the stdio auth provider has) and
  `durableSessionStore` (the live-session handle, kept in a Durable Object's
  storage so it survives hibernation).
- **`src/auth.js`** (`@spelling-creator/mcp/auth`): `refreshSupabaseSession`,
  the plain Supabase refresh-token-exchange call shared by the stdio server,
  `grantAuth`'s fallback, and the Worker's token endpoint (below).

On the Worker side (`apps/api`):

- **`src/routes/mcp.js`** wires up [`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider)
  with `HubMcp` (an `McpAgent` from the Cloudflare Agents SDK, one per MCP
  connection) as the `/mcp` API handler, and the existing Hono `app` as the
  `defaultHandler` for everything else. Supabase is the upstream identity: a
  grant's `props` carry a Supabase session captured at consent time, and a
  `tokenExchangeCallback` rotates it in step with the MCP client's own OAuth
  token refresh (kept a little shorter than Supabase's ~1h JWT lifetime), so a
  tool call's Supabase access token is normally already fresh with no extra
  round trip. `grantAuth` is the defense-in-depth fallback for a connection
  that outlives that cadence.
- **`src/routes/oauth.js`** implements the consent flow's two small endpoints
  (`GET /oauth/request`, `POST /oauth/approve`) that the `/oauth/authorize`
  web page calls. `/authorize` itself, `/token`, and dynamic client
  registration (`/register`) are otherwise implemented by the OAuthProvider
  library.
- The consent page is `apps/web/src/pages/OAuthAuthorizePage.jsx`, an ordinary
  route (`/oauth/authorize`) of the existing SPA.

### Infrastructure

Deploying this needs a KV namespace for the OAuth provider's grant/token
storage (also used for the consent flow's short-lived pending-request state)
and a Durable Object binding for `HubMcp`:

```bash
wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV
```

then fill the returned id into `OAUTH_KV` in `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc` (the
`HubMcp` Durable Object binding and its SQLite migration are already
declared). No new secrets are needed; the flow reuses the existing
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (via the same `verifySupabaseUser` every other
route uses) and the publishable `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`/`SPELLING_CREATOR_API_URL`
vars already in `wrangler.jsonc`.

### A note on the `agents` dependency

`apps/api` depends on `agents` (the Cloudflare Agents SDK, for `McpAgent`) and
`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`. One of `agents`' own transitive
dependencies, `@cfworker/json-schema`, probes `self.location` at module load
to pick a default base URI and throws on Workers' `location` global under this
Worker's compatibility settings, crashing the whole Worker before any request
is handled. Because the crash happens while Cloudflare evaluates the script's
top-level scope, the _upload_ fails too, with error code 10021: the deploy
never produces a broken version, it just refuses.

This is patched via `pnpm patch` to fall back to the library's own safe default
instead of throwing; `pnpm install` applies it automatically.

Three patches are needed, not one, because two of `agents`' other dependencies
**inline** their own copy of `@cfworker/json-schema` into their published
bundles. A `patchedDependencies` entry only rewrites the package pnpm installs,
so it cannot reach a copy baked into someone else's `dist/`:

| Patch                                               | Fixes                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `patches/@cfworker__json-schema@4.1.1.patch`        | the real package                                |
| `patches/@modelcontextprotocol__client@2.0.0.patch` | its copy in `dist/cfWorkerProvider-*.{mjs,cjs}` |
| `patches/@modelcontextprotocol__server@2.0.0.patch` | its copy in `dist/cfWorkerProvider-*.{mjs,cjs}` |

All three are registered under `patchedDependencies` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

Two traps when this resurfaces after a dependency bump. First, the stack trace
points at a path like
`node_modules/.pnpm/@modelcontextprotocol+client@2.0.0/node_modules/node_modules/.pnpm/@cfworker+json-schema@4.1.1/…`
that does not exist in your tree; it is a sourcemap path from the upstream
package's own build machine, and it is what gives the inlining away. Second,
the patched copies live in `.pnpm` directories carrying a `_patch_hash=` suffix,
so a path _without_ that suffix is an unpatched copy.

To check the fix actually reaches the shipped bundle rather than trusting the
install, bundle the Worker and grep the output; every hit should be inside a
`try`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @spelling-creator/api exec wrangler deploy --dry-run --outdir=/tmp/dryrun
grep -c 'initialBaseURI[0-9]* = typeof self' /tmp/dryrun/index.js   # expect 0
```
